The pipe-delimited patterns include:\n\nTemporal Forecasting Analysis: The forecaster considers the timing of events and deadlines when making predictions. This involves understanding the chronological sequence and temporal constraints that may impact the outcome. || Public Support or Opposition: The forecaster considers the level of public support or opposition when evaluating the potential outcomes of negotiations or agreements. || Reference to Specific Events or Developments: The forecaster references specific events or developments leading up to the question date in their rationale. This approach focuses on concrete occurrences rather than abstract patterns. || Consideration of External Influences: The forecaster considers external influences, such as international relations or sanctions, when making predictions. This involves analyzing how these factors might impact the outcome of a forecast. || Motivations and Incentives Discussion: The forecaster considers the motivations and incentives of the parties involved, which may help in understanding the dynamics of the situation. || Incorporation of Recent Trends and Forecasts: The forecaster evaluates economic indicators by incorporating recent trends and forecasts into their analysis. This approach involves analyzing current data and projections to inform predictions. || Stability of Leadership and Governance Structures: The forecaster considers the stability of leadership and governance structures when making predictions. This involves analyzing how consistent and reliable the leadership and governance are over time. || Synchronized Timing and Motivation Analysis: The forecaster considers both the timing of events and the motivations of key stakeholders when analyzing political scenarios. This approach contrasts with focusing solely on long-term trends. || Cooperation and Conflict Dynamics Evaluation: The forecaster evaluates the degree of cooperation or conflict between parties involved in a situation. This assessment can help in understanding the dynamics that may influence future events. || Economic Implications Focus: The forecaster considers the economic implications of decisions made by key stakeholders. This involves analyzing how these decisions might impact financial markets, trade, and economic growth. || Tension Dynamics Evaluation: The forecaster evaluates the potential for changes in tension levels, whether increasing or decreasing, when assessing the likelihood of significant events. || Historical Contextualization for Predictive Analysis: The forecaster considers the historical context of similar events when making predictions. This involves examining past occurrences to identify patterns or trends that may inform future outcomes. || Influential Decision-Makers Emphasis: The forecaster emphasizes the role of key influencers or decision-makers in a situation, rather than concentrating on broader trends. || Deadline-Driven Strategy Emphasis: The forecaster emphasizes specific actions or strategies of involved parties, particularly as deadlines approach, rather than discussing broader implications without direct event references.\n\nReturn scores for all 14 patterns, with exact titles/case from the prompt.

Israel has refused to do so, and the recent UN report has bolstered its position that the blockade was legal. Israel might consider quietly paying some kind of reparations, but Turkey's leadership is capitalizing politically on standing up to Israel diplomatically.
