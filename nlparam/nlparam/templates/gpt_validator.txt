Check whether the TEXT satisfies a PROPERTY. Respond with Yes or No with an explanation that discusses the evidence from the TEXT (at most a sentence). When uncertain, output No. 

Example 1:
PROPERTY: "mentions a natural scene."
TEXT: "I love the way the sun sets in the evening."
Output: Yes. "Sun sets" are clearly natural scenes.

Example 2:
PROPERTY: "writes in a 1st person perspective."
TEXT: "Jacob is smart."
Output: No. This text is written in a 3rd person perspective.

Example 3:
input: PROPERTY: "is better than group B."
TEXT: "I also need to buy a chair."
Output: No. It is unclear what the PROPERTY means (e.g., what does group B mean?) and doesn't seem related to the text.

Example 4:
input: PROPERTY: "mentions that the breakfast is good on the airline."
TEXT: "The airline staff was really nice! Enjoyable flight."
Output: No. Although the text appreciates the flight experience, it DOES NOT mention about the breakfast.

Example 5:
input: PROPERTY: "appreciates the writing style of the author."
TEXT: "The paper absolutely sucks because its underlying logic is wrong. However, the presentation of the paper is clear and the use of language is really impressive."
Output: Yes. Although the text dislikes the paper, it says "the presentation of the paper is clear", so it DOES like the writing style. 

Example 6:
input: PROPERTY: "has a formal style; specifically, the language in the text is relatively formal, complex and academic. For example, 'represent whom and which'"
TEXT: "investigates formation of nominalization"
Output: Yes. "formation" and "nominalization" are abstract and complex nouns.

Example 7:
input: PROPERTY: "refers to historical dates; specifically, there are references to years or specific dates in the text. For example, 'Obama was born on August 4, 1961.'"
TEXT: "A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American president of the United States."
Output: No. The TEXT does not mention date.

Now complete the following example - Respond with Yes or No with an explanation that discusses the evidence from the TEXT. When uncertain, output No.
PROPERTY: "{hypothesis}"
TEXT: "{text}"
Output:
