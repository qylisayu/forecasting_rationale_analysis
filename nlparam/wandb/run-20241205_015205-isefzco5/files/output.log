Sample 11: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 12: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: -0.0)

Sample 16: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.0)
Sample 17: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: 0.0)

Sample 19: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: 0.0)
Sample 20: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.0)
Sample 21: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.0)
Sample 22: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: 0.0)

Sample 24: It seems that the US needs to do something of this sort on a fast time table. (score: 0.0)
Sample 25: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.0)

Sample 27: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: 0.0)
Sample 28: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.0)
Sample 29: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: 0.0)
Sample 30: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.0)
Sample 31: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.1)
Sample 32: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: 0.1)
Sample 33: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: 0.1)
Sample 34: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.1)
Sample 35: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.1)

Sample 37: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: 0.1)
Sample 38: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.1)
Sample 39: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.1)
Sample 40: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR

 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.1)
Sample 41: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.1)
Sample 42: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.1)
Sample 43: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.1)
Sample 44: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 45: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.1)
Sample 46: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.1)
Sample 47: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.1)
Sample 48: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.1)
Sample 49: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.1)
Sample 50: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances.

Sample 56: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.3)

We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions.

Sample 10: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.1)
Sample 11: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.0)
Sample 12: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 13: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 14: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.0)
Sample 15: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 16: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next.

Sample 17: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: -0.0)
Sample 18: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.0)
Sample 19: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: 0.0)
Sample 20: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.0)
Sample 21: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.0)
Sample 22: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: 0.0)
Sample 23: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR

 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.0)
Sample 24: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: 0.0)
Sample 25: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.0)
Sample 26: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.0)
Sample 27: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: 0.0)
Sample 28: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: 0.0)

Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.0)
Sample 30: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.0)
Sample 31: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.0)
Sample 32: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: 0.0)
Sample 33: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.0)
Sample 34: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war.

Sample 35: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: 0.1)
Sample 36: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 37: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.1)

Sample 41: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.1)
Sample 42: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.1)
Sample 43: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.1)
Sample 44: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.1)
Sample 45: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.1)
Sample 46: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.1)
Sample 47: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.1)
Sample 48: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.1)
Sample 49: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.1)
Sample 50: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.1)

Sample 54: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.2)

Sample 0: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.3)

(score: 0.3)
Sample 2: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.3)
Sample 3: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.3)
Sample 4: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.3)

Sample 6: Following teammates

 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.

 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: 0.3)
Sample 7: Following teammates

 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: 0.3)
Sample 8: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.4)
Sample 9: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.4)
Sample 10: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.4)
Sample 11: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.4)
Sample 12: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: 0.4)
Sample 13: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 14: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: 0.4)
Sample 15: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: 0.4)
Sample 16: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR

 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.4)
Sample 17: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.4)
Sample 18: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.4)
Sample 19: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.4)
Sample 20: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.4)
Sample 21: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: 0.4)
Sample 22: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: 0.4)
Sample 23: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 24: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.4)
Sample 25: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.4)
Sample 26: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.5)
Sample 27: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: 0.5)
Sample 28: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.5)
Sample 29: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.5)
Sample 30: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: 0.5)
Sample 31: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: 0.5)
Sample 32: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.5)
Sample 33: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.5)
Sample 34: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: 0.5)
Sample 35: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: 0.5)
Sample 36: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.5)
Sample 37: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.5)
Sample 38: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: 0.5)
Sample 39: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.5)
Sample 40: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.5)
Sample 41: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.5)
Sample 42: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: 0.5)
Sample 43: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: 0.5)
Sample 44: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.5)
Sample 45: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.5)
Sample 46: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 47: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: 0.5)
Sample 48: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.5)
Sample 49: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 50: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections.

Sample 52: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question.

Sample 10: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.2)
Sample 11: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: -0.2)
Sample 12: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)
Sample 13: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 14: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future.

Sample 15: It seems that the US needs to do something of this sort on a fast time table. (score: -0.1)
Sample 16: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: -0.1)
Sample 17: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.1)
Sample 18: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)
Sample 19: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.1)
Sample 20: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point.

Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)

Sample 28: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: -0.1)
Sample 29: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.1)
Sample 30: Following teammates

 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.

Sample 32: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.1)
Sample 33: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.1)
Sample 34: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 36: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.0)
Sample 45: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.0)
Sample 46: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: -0.0)
Sample 47: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 48: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.0)

Sample 52: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.1)

Sample 58: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.6)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 7: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: -0.1)
Sample 8: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.1)
Sample 9: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.1)
Sample 10: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 11: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.1)
Sample 12: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.1)
Sample 13: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 14: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 15: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 16: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.0)
Sample 17: Following teammates

 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.

 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: -0.0)
Sample 18: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 19: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.0)
Sample 20: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.0)
Sample 21: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.0)
Sample 22: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: -0.0)
Sample 23: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.0)
Sample 24: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.0)
Sample 25: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: 0.0)
Sample 26: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 27: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: 0.0)
Sample 28: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.0)
Sample 29: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 30: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.1)
Sample 31: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.1)
Sample 32: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.1)
Sample 33: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: 0.1)
Sample 34: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: 0.1)
Sample 35: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.1)
Sample 36: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.1)
Sample 37: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.1)
Sample 38: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: 0.1)
Sample 39: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.1)
Sample 40: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR

 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.1)
Sample 41: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: 0.2)
Sample 42: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.2)
Sample 43: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.2)
Sample 44: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.2)
Sample 45: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.2)
Sample 46: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.2)
Sample 47: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.2)
Sample 48: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.3)
Sample 49: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.3)
Sample 50: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: 0.3)

Sample 52: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.3)

Sample 54: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.1)
Sample 15: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: -0.1)
Sample 16: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.1)
Sample 17: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 18: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 21: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.1)
Sample 22: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.1)
Sample 23: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)
Sample 24: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: -0.1)

Sample 27: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)
Sample 29: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)
Sample 30: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: -0.1)
Sample 31: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: -0.1)
Sample 32: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.1)
Sample 33: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.0)
Sample 34: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: -0.0)
Sample 35: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.0)
Sample 36: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.0)
Sample 37: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 38: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.0)
Sample 39: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: -0.0)
Sample 40: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.0)
Sample 41: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.0)
Sample 42: Following teammates

 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.

 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: 0.0)
Sample 43: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.0)
Sample 44: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.0)
Sample 45: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.1)
Sample 46: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.1)
Sample 47: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 48: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.1)
Sample 49: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 50: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.1)

Sample 54: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next.

Sample 58: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.8)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

Sample 12: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.2)
Sample 13: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 17: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)
Sample 18: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.1)
Sample 19: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)
Sample 20: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.1)

Sample 23: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.1)

Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.1)
Sample 25: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 27: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.1)

Sample 31: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: -0.1)
Sample 32: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.1)
Sample 33: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections.

Sample 40: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.0)
Sample 41: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.0)
Sample 42: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: -0.0)
Sample 43: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 44: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 45: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.0)
Sample 46: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds.

Sample 48: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.0)
Sample 49: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.1)

Sample 54: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.1)

Sample 56: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 57: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 58: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.6)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 0: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.1)

Sample 3: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 4: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.0)

Sample 6: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: -0.0)
Sample 7: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: -0.0)
Sample 8: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: -0.0)

Sample 10: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: -0.0)
Sample 11: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.0)
Sample 12: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.0)
Sample 13: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.0)
Sample 14: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR

 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.0)
Sample 15: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.0)
Sample 16: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: 0.0)
Sample 17: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.0)
Sample 18: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.0)
Sample 19: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: 0.0)
Sample 20: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.1)
Sample 21: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.1)
Sample 22: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.1)
Sample 23: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.1)
Sample 24: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.1)
Sample 25: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 26: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.1)
Sample 27: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.1)
Sample 28: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.1)
Sample 29: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.1)
Sample 30: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: 0.1)
Sample 31: Following teammates

 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.

 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: 0.1)
Sample 32: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.2)
Sample 33: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: 0.2)
Sample 34: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.2)
Sample 35: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: 0.2)
Sample 36: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: 0.2)
Sample 37: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: 0.2)
Sample 38: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: 0.2)
Sample 39: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2225797&language=en (score: 0.2)
Sample 40: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: 0.2)
Sample 41: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: 0.2)
Sample 42: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.3)
Sample 43: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.3)
Sample 44: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.3)
Sample 45: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: 0.3)
Sample 46: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.3)
Sample 47: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: 0.3)
Sample 48: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: 0.3)
Sample 49: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: 0.3)
Sample 50: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: 0.3)
Sample 51: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: 0.3)
Sample 52: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: 0.3)
Sample 53: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: 0.3)

Sample 55: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: 0.3)
Sample 56: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 13: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 18: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.1)
Sample 19: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)

Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.1)
Sample 25: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 26: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)
Sample 27: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next.

Sample 28: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation.

Sample 30: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long.

Sample 32: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat.

The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.0)
Sample 41: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.0)
Sample 42: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: -0.0)
Sample 43: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 44: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 45: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.0)
Sample 46: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: 0.0)
Sample 47: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.0)
Sample 48: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.0)
Sample 49: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.1)
Sample 50: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: 0.1)

Sample 52: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.1)

Sample 54: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.1)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 2: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam.

Sample 9: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.3)
Sample 10: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.3)
Sample 11: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.3)
Sample 12: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.3)
Sample 13: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.3)
Sample 14: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: -0.3)
Sample 15: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: -0.3)
Sample 16: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.3)
Sample 17: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: -0.3)
Sample 18: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.3)
Sample 19: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.3)
Sample 20: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.3)
Sample 21: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.3)
Sample 22: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.2)
Sample 23: Following teammates

 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.

 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: -0.2)
Sample 24: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: -0.2)
Sample 25: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 26: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.2)
Sample 27: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: -0.2)
Sample 28: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: -0.2)
Sample 29: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: -0.2)
Sample 30: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: -0.2)
Sample 31: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: -0.2)
Sample 32: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: -0.2)
Sample 33: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.2)
Sample 34: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.2)
Sample 35: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: -0.2)
Sample 36: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: -0.2)
Sample 37: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.1)
Sample 38: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: -0.1)
Sample 39: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.1)
Sample 40: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: -0.1)
Sample 41: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.1)
Sample 42: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)
Sample 43: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 44: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: -0.1)
Sample 45: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: -0.1)
Sample 46: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.1)
Sample 47: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)
Sample 48: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.1)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 2: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 4: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.2)

Sample 10: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.2)
Sample 11: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 12: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future.

Sample 13: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 14: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: -0.1)
Sample 15: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 16: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.1)
Sample 17: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized.

Sample 18: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.1)
Sample 19: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.1)
Sample 20: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: -0.1)
Sample 21: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.1)
Sample 22: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: -0.1)

Sample 26: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her.

Sample 27: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.1)
Sample 29: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 30: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 31: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: -0.1)
Sample 32: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: -0.1)
Sample 33: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: -0.1)
Sample 34: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)
Sample 35: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.1)
Sample 36: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.1)
Sample 37: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: -0.1)
Sample 38: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: -0.1)
Sample 39: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.1)
Sample 40: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: -0.1)
Sample 41: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: -0.1)
Sample 42: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: -0.1)
Sample 43: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.1)

As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.1)
Sample 46: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)
Sample 47: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 4: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam.

Sample 11: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.3)
Sample 12: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.3)
Sample 13: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: -0.3)
Sample 14: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.3)
Sample 15: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently.

Sample 16: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.3)
Sample 17: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.3)
Sample 18: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.3)
Sample 19: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.3)
Sample 20: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.3)
Sample 21: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.3)
Sample 22: Following teammates

 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.

 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: -0.3)
Sample 23: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.3)
Sample 24: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.2)
Sample 25: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.2)
Sample 26: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.2)

Sample 28: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 32: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: -0.2)
Sample 33: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: -0.2)
Sample 34: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: -0.2)
Sample 35: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: -0.2)
Sample 36: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 37: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: -0.1)
Sample 38: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.1)
Sample 39: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.1)
Sample 40: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: -0.1)
Sample 41: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 42: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)
Sample 43: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.1)
Sample 44: Russia says it will allow this rate.

Sample 45: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: -0.1)
Sample 46: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)

How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: -0.0)
Sample 54: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: -0.0)

Sample 56: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.0)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 0: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.1)

Sample 4: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: 0.1)

Sample 6: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.1)

Sample 8: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.1)

Sample 10: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.1)
Sample 11: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: 0.1)
Sample 12: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.1)
Sample 13: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.1)
Sample 14: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.1)
Sample 15: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR

 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.1)
Sample 16: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: 0.1)
Sample 17: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 18: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.1)
Sample 19: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 20: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.2)
Sample 21: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.2)
Sample 22: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.2)
Sample 23: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.2)
Sample 24: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: 0.2)
Sample 25: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.2)
Sample 26: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: 0.2)
Sample 27: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.2)
Sample 28: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: 0.2)
Sample 29: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.2)
Sample 30: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: 0.2)
Sample 31: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: 0.3)
Sample 32: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2225797&language=en (score: 0.3)
Sample 33: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: 0.3)
Sample 34: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.3)
Sample 35: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.3)
Sample 36: Following teammates

 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.

 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: 0.3)
Sample 37: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.3)
Sample 38: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.3)
Sample 39: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: 0.3)
Sample 40: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: 0.3)
Sample 41: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.3)
Sample 42: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.3)
Sample 43: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: 0.3)
Sample 44: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: 0.3)
Sample 45: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: 0.4)
Sample 46: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 47: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: 0.4)
Sample 48: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: 0.4)
Sample 49: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: 0.4)
Sample 50: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: 0.4)

Sample 52: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.4)

Sample 55: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: 0.4)
Sample 56: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 24: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: -0.1)
Sample 25: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: -0.1)
Sample 26: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: -0.1)
Sample 27: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 31: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat.

I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.1)
Sample 34: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.1)
Sample 35: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.1)
Sample 36: Following teammates

 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.

 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: -0.1)
Sample 37: It seems that the US needs to do something of this sort on a fast time table. (score: -0.1)
Sample 38: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)
Sample 39: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.1)
Sample 40: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.1)
Sample 41: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.0)
Sample 42: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: -0.0)
Sample 43: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: -0.0)
Sample 44: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.0)
Sample 45: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.0)
Sample 46: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: 0.0)
Sample 47: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.0)
Sample 48: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.0)
Sample 49: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.0)
Sample 50: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.1)
Sample 51: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.1)
Sample 52: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: 0.1)

Sample 54: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.1)

Sample 56: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 0: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: -0.3)

Sample 2: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: -0.2)

Sample 4: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.2)

Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored.

Sample 10: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: -0.2)
Sample 11: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: -0.2)

Sample 13: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: -0.2)
Sample 14: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.2)
Sample 15: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: -0.2)
Sample 16: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.2)
Sample 17: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: -0.2)
Sample 18: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: -0.2)
Sample 19: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.1)
Sample 20: Following teammates

 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.

 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: -0.1)
Sample 21: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: -0.1)
Sample 22: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 23: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: -0.1)
Sample 24: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.

 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.1)
Sample 25: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR

 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: -0.1)
Sample 26: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 27: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: -0.1)
Sample 29: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.1)
Sample 30: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.1)
Sample 31: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.1)
Sample 32: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.1)
Sample 33: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.1)
Sample 34: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: -0.1)
Sample 35: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)
Sample 36: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.1)
Sample 37: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: -0.1)
Sample 38: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.1)
Sample 39: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 40: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)
Sample 41: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 42: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)
Sample 43: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: -0.1)
Sample 44: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: -0.1)
Sample 45: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.

 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.

 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.1)
Sample 46: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.1)
Sample 47: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.0)
Sample 48: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 49: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future.

Sample 52: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized.

Sample 54: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
Again, here's the goal.
