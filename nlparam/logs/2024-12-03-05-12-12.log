Sample 2: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.0)

Sample 6: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.0)

Sample 8: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future.

Sample 10: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.0)

Sample 12: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: 0.0)
Sample 13: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: 0.0)
Sample 14: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.0)
Sample 15: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.0)
Sample 16: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2225797&language=en (score: 0.0)
Sample 17: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: 0.0)
Sample 18: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.0)
Sample 19: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.1)
Sample 20: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.1)
Sample 21: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 22: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 23: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.1)
Sample 24: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: 0.1)
Sample 25: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.1)
Sample 26: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.1)
Sample 27: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 28: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: 0.1)
Sample 29: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: 0.1)
Sample 30: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 31: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.1)
Sample 32: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: 0.1)
Sample 33: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 34: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.1)
Sample 35: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: 0.1)
Sample 36: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.1)
Sample 37: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.1)
Sample 38: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: 0.1)
Sample 39: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.1)
Sample 40: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 41: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.1)
Sample 42: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.1)
Sample 43: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: 0.1)
Sample 44: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.1)
Sample 45: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.1)
Sample 46: It seems that the US needs to do something of this sort on a fast time table. (score: 0.1)
Sample 47: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html
 
 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR
 
 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.1)
Sample 48: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.2)
Sample 49: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.2)
Sample 50: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: 0.2)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 12: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 13: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: 0.1)
Sample 14: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 15: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.1)
Sample 16: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.1)
Sample 17: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats.

Sample 18: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: 0.1)
Sample 19: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.1)

Sample 24: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat.

Sample 26: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.1)
Sample 27: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.1)
Sample 28: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: 0.1)
Sample 29: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 30: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: 0.1)
Sample 31: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: 0.1)
Sample 32: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: 0.1)
Sample 33: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.2)
Sample 34: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.2)
Sample 35: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.2)
Sample 36: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.2)
Sample 37: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: 0.2)
Sample 38: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.2)
Sample 39: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 41: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: 0.2)
Sample 42: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.2)

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR
 
 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.2)
Sample 45: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 46: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.2)
Sample 47: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored.

Sample 48: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.2)

Sample 50: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.2)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 21: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.4)
Sample 22: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.4)
Sample 23: Russia says it will allow this rate.

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR
 
 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.4)
Sample 24: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2225797&language=en (score: 0.4)
Sample 25: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 26: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.4)
Sample 27: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.4)
Sample 28: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.4)
Sample 29: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 30: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.4)
Sample 31: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.4)
Sample 32: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 33: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 34: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.4)
Sample 35: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 36: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 37: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.4)
Sample 38: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.4)
Sample 39: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.4)
Sample 40: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: 0.5)
Sample 41: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: 0.5)
Sample 42: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: 0.5)
Sample 43: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: 0.5)
Sample 44: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.5)
Sample 45: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: 0.5)
Sample 46: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.5)
Sample 47: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: 0.5)
Sample 48: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: 0.5)
Sample 49: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: 0.5)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 7: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: -0.2)
Sample 8: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.2)

Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.2)
Sample 10: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.2)
Sample 11: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: -0.2)
Sample 12: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: -0.2)
Sample 13: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.2)
Sample 14: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: -0.2)
Sample 15: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: -0.2)
Sample 16: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: -0.2)
Sample 17: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.2)

Sample 22: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: -0.2)
Sample 23: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.2)
Sample 24: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: -0.1)
Sample 25: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: -0.1)
Sample 26: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.1)
Sample 27: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.1)
Sample 29: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.1)
Sample 30: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.1)
Sample 31: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: -0.1)
Sample 32: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.0)
Sample 33: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.0)
Sample 34: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.0)
Sample 35: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 36: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: -0.0)
Sample 37: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: -0.0)
Sample 38: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.0)
Sample 39: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.0)
Sample 40: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.0)
Sample 41: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.0)
Sample 42: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: 0.0)
Sample 43: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: 0.0)
Sample 44: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.0)
Sample 45: Following teammates
 
 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.
 
 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: 0.1)
Sample 46: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 47: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next.

Sample 49: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: 0.1)
Sample 50: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: -0.1)
Sample 15: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.1)
Sample 16: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 17: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 18: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.1)
Sample 19: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 20: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.1)
Sample 21: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.1)
Sample 22: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.1)
Sample 23: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)
Sample 24: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.1)
Sample 25: Following teammates
 
 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.
 
 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: -0.1)
Sample 26: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 27: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.0)
Sample 29: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: -0.0)
Sample 30: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: -0.0)
Sample 31: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.0)
Sample 32: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.0)
Sample 33: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.0)
Sample 34: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.0)
Sample 35: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: 0.0)
Sample 36: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: 0.1)
Sample 37: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.1)
Sample 38: Russia says it will allow this rate.

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR
 
 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.1)
Sample 39: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.1)
Sample 40: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.1)
Sample 41: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 42: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: 0.1)
Sample 43: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.1)
Sample 44: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.1)
Sample 45: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: 0.1)
Sample 46: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.1)
Sample 47: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.1)
Sample 48: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.1)
Sample 49: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.2)
Sample 50: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.2)

Sample 52: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.2)

Sample 54: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.2)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.
