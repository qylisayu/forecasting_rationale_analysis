Sample 6: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.3)

(score: 0.3)
Sample 8: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.3)

Sample 10: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: 0.3)
Sample 11: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.3)
Sample 12: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.4)
Sample 13: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.4)
Sample 14: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.4)
Sample 15: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.4)
Sample 16: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: 0.4)
Sample 17: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2225797&language=en (score: 0.4)
Sample 18: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.4)
Sample 19: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.4)
Sample 20: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: 0.4)
Sample 21: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: 0.4)
Sample 22: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html
 
 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR
 
 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.4)
Sample 23: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: 0.4)
Sample 24: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.4)
Sample 25: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.4)
Sample 26: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 27: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.4)
Sample 28: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.4)
Sample 29: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.4)
Sample 30: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.4)
Sample 31: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 32: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 33: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.4)
Sample 34: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.4)
Sample 35: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 36: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: 0.4)
Sample 37: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.4)
Sample 38: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: 0.4)
Sample 39: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.4)
Sample 40: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: 0.4)
Sample 41: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.4)
Sample 42: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.5)
Sample 43: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.5)
Sample 44: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: 0.5)
Sample 45: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: 0.5)
Sample 46: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: 0.5)
Sample 47: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: 0.5)
Sample 48: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: 0.5)
Sample 49: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: 0.5)
Sample 50: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.5)

Sample 52: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 11: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.0)
Sample 12: It seems that the US needs to do something of this sort on a fast time table. (score: 0.0)

Sample 14: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.0)
Sample 15: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: 0.0)
Sample 16: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.0)
Sample 17: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: 0.0)
Sample 18: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.1)
Sample 19: Following teammates
 
 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.
 
 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: 0.1)
Sample 20: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: 0.1)
Sample 21: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 22: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: 0.1)
Sample 23: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 24: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.1)

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR
 
 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.1)
Sample 26: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.1)
Sample 27: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.1)
Sample 28: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.1)
Sample 29: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.1)
Sample 30: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: 0.1)
Sample 31: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.1)
Sample 32: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.1)
Sample 33: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.1)
Sample 34: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.1)
Sample 35: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.1)
Sample 36: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2225797&language=en (score: 0.1)
Sample 37: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.1)
Sample 38: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: 0.1)
Sample 39: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: 0.1)
Sample 40: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.2)
Sample 41: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.2)
Sample 42: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.2)
Sample 43: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.2)
Sample 44: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.2)
Sample 45: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.2)
Sample 46: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.2)
Sample 47: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.2)
Sample 48: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.2)
Sample 49: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: 0.2)
Sample 50: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam.

Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.1)
Sample 26: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.1)
Sample 27: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 28: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.1)
Sample 29: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: 0.1)
Sample 30: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 31: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: 0.1)
Sample 32: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: 0.1)
Sample 33: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.1)
Sample 34: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.1)
Sample 35: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: 0.1)
Sample 36: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.1)
Sample 37: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.1)
Sample 38: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: 0.1)
Sample 39: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.1)
Sample 40: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long.

Sample 41: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.2)

Sample 45: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: 0.2)
Sample 46: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.2)

Sample 52: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.3)

Sample 56: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.2)
Sample 23: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: -0.2)
Sample 24: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.1)
Sample 25: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: -0.1)
Sample 26: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 27: Russia says it will allow this rate.

 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR
 
 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.1)
Sample 29: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.1)
Sample 30: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: -0.1)
Sample 31: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.1)
Sample 32: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.1)
Sample 33: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.1)
Sample 34: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)
Sample 35: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: -0.1)
Sample 36: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.1)
Sample 37: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: -0.1)
Sample 38: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 39: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.1)
Sample 40: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)
Sample 41: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 42: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)
Sample 43: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.1)
Sample 44: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: -0.1)
Sample 45: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.1)
Sample 46: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: -0.1)
Sample 47: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.0)
Sample 48: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.0)
Sample 49: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: -0.0)

Sample 52: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized.

Sample 54: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.2)

Sample 22: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.2)
Sample 23: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.2)
Sample 24: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: -0.2)
Sample 25: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: -0.2)
Sample 26: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 28: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.2)
Sample 29: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 32: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: -0.2)
Sample 33: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.2)
Sample 34: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.2)
Sample 35: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.2)
Sample 36: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: -0.1)
Sample 37: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.1)
Sample 38: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized.

Sample 39: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 40: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 41: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: -0.1)
Sample 42: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)
Sample 43: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: -0.1)

Sample 50: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 10: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: -0.2)
Sample 11: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.2)
Sample 12: Following teammates
 
 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.
 
 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: -0.2)
Sample 13: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.2)
Sample 14: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 15: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 16: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.1)
Sample 17: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 18: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.1)

 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: -0.1)
Sample 20: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: -0.1)
Sample 21: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 22: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.1)
Sample 23: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 24: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: -0.1)

Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.1)
Sample 30: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: -0.1)
Sample 31: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: -0.1)
Sample 32: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)
Sample 33: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: -0.1)
Sample 34: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.1)
Sample 35: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: -0.1)
Sample 36: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

Sample 38: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)
Sample 39: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 40: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.0)
Sample 41: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.0)
Sample 42: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.0)
Sample 43: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.0)
Sample 44: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: -0.0)
Sample 45: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: -0.0)
Sample 46: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.0)
Sample 47: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: -0.0)
Sample 48: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.0)
Sample 49: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.0)
Sample 50: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.

Sample 54: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.1)

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

2024-12-05 21:03:40 - propose.py - Line 549 - DEBUG - Here is a corpus of text samples each associated with a score. The text samples are sorted from the lowest to the highest score.
Sample 0: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 2: It seems that the US needs to do something of this sort on a fast time table. (score: -0.2)
Sample 3: It seems that the US needs to do something of this sort on a fast time table. (score: -0.2)
Sample 4: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: -0.2)
Sample 5: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: -0.2)
Sample 6: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: -0.2)
Sample 7: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: -0.2)
Sample 8: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: -0.2)
Sample 9: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: -0.2)
Sample 10: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.2)
Sample 11: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: -0.2)
Sample 12: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: -0.2)
Sample 13: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.1)
Sample 14: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.1)
Sample 15: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.1)
Sample 16: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2225797&language=en (score: -0.1)
Sample 17: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.1)
Sample 18: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.1)
Sample 19: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.1)
Sample 20: Following teammates
 
 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.
 
 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: -0.1)
Sample 21: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.1)
Sample 22: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 23: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 24: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 25: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: -0.1)
Sample 26: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.1)
Sample 27: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: -0.0)
Sample 29: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: 0.0)
Sample 30: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.0)
Sample 31: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: 0.0)
Sample 32: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: 0.0)
Sample 33: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: 0.1)
Sample 34: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: 0.1)
Sample 35: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: 0.1)
Sample 36: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: 0.1)
Sample 37: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html
 
 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR
 
 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: 0.1)
Sample 38: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: 0.1)
Sample 39: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: 0.1)
Sample 40: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: 0.1)
Sample 41: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: 0.1)
Sample 42: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: 0.1)
Sample 43: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: 0.1)
Sample 44: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: 0.1)
Sample 45: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.1)
Sample 46: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: 0.1)
Sample 47: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: 0.2)
Sample 48: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: 0.2)
Sample 49: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: 0.2)
Sample 50: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: 0.2)

Sample 52: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: 0.2)

Sample 54: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: 0.2)

Sample 56: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: 0.2)

Sample 59: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: 0.2)
Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 0: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: -0.2)

Sample 2: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.2)
Sample 3: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.2)
Sample 4: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.2)

I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.2)
Sample 6: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: -0.2)
Sample 7: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: -0.2)
Sample 8: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.2)

(score: -0.2)
Sample 10: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.2)
Sample 11: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.2)
Sample 12: FTAs take a while to negotiate. Looks like they've been talking about this since 2012: http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-india-interested-in-establishing-trade-agreement-with-peru-12135  This looks like the latest, an invite from India to Peruvian negotiators to come to India to talk. http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-russia-india-and-salvador-eye-free-trade-agreements-with-peru-101647   (score: -0.1)
Sample 13: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: -0.1)
Sample 14: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 15: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.1)
Sample 16: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: -0.1)
Sample 17: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html
 
 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR
 
 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: -0.1)
Sample 18: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.1)
Sample 19: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: -0.1)
Sample 20: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point. (score: -0.1)
Sample 21: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.1)
Sample 22: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 23: It seems that the US needs to do something of this sort on a fast time table. (score: -0.1)
Sample 24: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: -0.1)
Sample 25: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: -0.1)
Sample 26: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 27: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve. According to Bloomberg once the panel is established, they have 6 months to decide.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-eu-china-rareearths-idUSBRE85Q0KJ20120627  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/wto-to-investigate-chinese-curbs-on-rare-earth-exports.html  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bc6d14e-a6f0-11e0-a808-00144feabdc0.html#axzz266hX2lyj  This guy argues that it is irrelevant as many countries see the strategic value of rare earths and are gearing up their own production: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/25/w (score: -0.1)
Sample 29: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: -0.1)
Sample 30: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: -0.1)
Sample 31: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2225797&language=en (score: -0.1)
Sample 32: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 33: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.1)
Sample 34: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: -0.1)
Sample 35: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: -0.1)
Sample 36: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: -0.1)
Sample 37: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 38: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: -0.1)
Sample 39: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: -0.1)
Sample 40: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.1)
Sample 41: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: -0.1)
Sample 42: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: -0.0)
Sample 43: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: -0.0)
Sample 44: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.0)
Sample 45: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: -0.0)
Sample 46: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.0)
Sample 47: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: -0.0)
Sample 48: Following teammates
 
 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.
 
 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: -0.0)
Sample 49: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 50: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.0)

(score: -0.0)
Sample 52: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: 0.0)

Sample 54: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: 0.1)

Sample 56: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable). 
Again, here's the goal.

Sample 0: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.3)
Sample 1: A big conflagration in the ECS (or Sea of Japan) could lead to Abe going by the shrine. But this is a very unlikely branch to go down. Hedging. (score: -0.3)
Sample 2: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.3)
Sample 3: Everyone is on high alert and enough time has passed that the risk impulsive lone crazies with resources should be largely flushed.
 
 As noted by others the base rate is actually much lower even with the low trigger and we are getting past the copycat risk time frame. (score: -0.3)
Sample 4: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: -0.2)
Sample 5: He appears to be in serious trouble and facing a jail term or possible military coup. The question is whether it will come to a head by end of March   (score: -0.2)
Sample 6: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.2)
Sample 7: I hadn't heard that they had deployed any Iskanders at all. This is just a hunch. (score: -0.2)
Sample 8: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.2)
Sample 9: That is an awfully aggressive timetable for that to happen. (score: -0.2)
Sample 10: I have not found any news on this since May, when Israeli PM said he wanted early elections. Since elections are currently not scheduled until 2013 and there are no new developments, I will base my prediction on current schedule until something new breaks. This should be monitored. (score: -0.2)
Sample 11: They will pass a meaningless resolution of some kind in typical UN fashion.  (score: -0.2)
Sample 12: Base Rate:  My base rate was maybe 5% because 8-10 weeks is not really enough time to hold this scale of elections, and certainly not ones likely to have a sense of legitimacy and mandate.  The 5% was in case folks decided they didn't care about those 2 items.  Based on Paul's link it looks like the plan is to do things properly so I am adjusting accordingly. (score: -0.2)
Sample 13: Things are teetering on the brink, with the cleric calling for mass demonstrations against the government in the post-Ramadan weeks. Much depends on what one means by "formally" here, but he has already declared his lack of confidence in and approval of the government's performance and it would not seem possible for the government to adequately the address the source of his accusations in the minds of poor Iraqis in the immediate future. (score: -0.1)
Sample 14: so far, the government has not announced when the elections will take place. This question like most of the others is premature and about a subject of relatively little importance. How does it test predicting skills to ask us about such obscure issues? Are we not going to get any questions on more significant subjects such as the US elections, the European debt crisis or the economy? (score: -0.1)
Sample 15: Italy is among the EU country's whose debt situation looks most parlous, but it has deeper reserves to draw upon than Greece, Portugal or Spain and is most unlikely to default in present circumstances. Restructuring is a little different, but with so much EU attention and resources being committed to the more parlous cases, Italy is likely to postpone such action into next year. Of course, if Greece were to fail, things could start to cascade fairly quickly.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 16: Basically, why not? There's little downside to a new resolution in light of increased concerns reported today about nukes. (score: -0.1)
Sample 17: Lots of good reading to be had on this one. I think that the broad contours of the question are, distributed responsibility and oversight of Chinese forces in surrounding waters makes command and control difficult, Chinese nationalism and a stalling economy might drive a conflict/incident, and the 10-year leadership turnover is done, so there's less restraint up top.  There's a possibility of conflict, although it is more likely to be Chinese fishermen and authorities from other countries than MLE or Chinese Navy and other government vessels. China tries not to let their Navy/MLE to roam too far, and Japan/US are not the primary "bumpers" over the last decade: those titles go to the Philippines and Vietnam. But, a chance of conflict exists.

Sample 18: Don't have a good feel for this. Does anyone in the group know much about IMF, its sanctions history, etc.? (score: -0.1)
Sample 19: This branch is really unlikely but if it happens it would signal a major shift in Pakistani Taliban thinking.   Going to explain more in branch 2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 20: It seems that the US needs to do something of this sort on a fast time table. (score: -0.1)
Sample 21: Lots of time for new and interesting events to trigger a reaction. Historic data suggests as a baseline this is more likely to happen in the given time frame than not. (score: -0.1)
Sample 22: Such recognition has been pushed for and has quite a bit of momentum, but there are serious obstacles and considerable resistance, so it seems probable that he deadline will be pushed forward at least somewhat. Perhaps the key to the problem is the chronic disunity among the Palestinians themselves and the sheer improbability of their being able to take responsibility for a state even if it was recognized. (score: -0.1)
Sample 23: Interesting that this question closes on the inauguration day in the U.S.  I'll put a more detailed explanation of my prediction in a follow on post. I don't think this is going to happen, although 10 Iranian deaths is a rather low threshold. I wouldn't define 10 as "significant" in the context of international politics. (score: -0.1)
Sample 24: This is about Moody's dislike of the S. European bailout. It has nothing to do with the state of the German economy or the value of it's bonds. As long as Merkel government continues to support bailout(s) in Greece, Spain, etc., Moody's will follow this course. Consider the downgrade of US Treasury Bonds a few months ago by S & P. (score: -0.1)
Sample 25: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html  Very unsure about this question. Even if he returns, is that enough time to get a trial started? I don't think he's going back to Egypt before 1 Jan 2013. He could be tried in absentia though. (score: -0.1)
Sample 26: Though most major countries are siding with the Syrian people, it seems that the US will not resort to military force in the near future, as it is believed that peaceful measures should be taken to restore democracy there and/or that Syria will erupt in a civil war. I would imagine that a lot of other countries share the US's reluctance to use military force. See the article below:

http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2225797&language=en (score: -0.1)
Sample 27: No need to make her more of a celebrity by arresting her. Censoring her and keeping her followers in line more easily accomplished and causes less ripple effects in the system. 10% for the possibility of a mistake by the CCP.  http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-bo-xilai-wang-zheng/1788320.html (score: -0.1)
Sample 28: Based on Wikipedia, Civic Platform has won a plurality of seats since 2007, and I see no clear event that seems likely to reduce its probability of doing so again. I estimate that the largest parliamentary party tends to remain so in most countries. (score: -0.1)
Sample 29: Seems that TPP would be an expense of political capital by Abe. Japanese don't seem that supportive. They are 20 seats short of a majority right now and half the seats in the upper house (242 total, 121 up) are up for re-election. Can they retain all the seats they have AND capture 21 more? Not sure.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 30: US backing for basic defense is key in the time frame. US is unlikely to support this move in the current situation. Between that and risks of hurting relations with Iran and Turkey this seems a long way off for a pragmatic government, and the Kurds have been very pragmatic. (score: -0.1)
Sample 31: 350 members in the CPC. No one is clean. Who has stepped out of line and is the next to be offered up as sacrifice? Zhou Yangkang might be next. Part of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign? Bo went down and so have several others recently. No one is above the rulings of the PBSC.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-vogl/chinas-rising-anticorrupt_b_3881234.html http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-corruption-crackdown-florcruz/index.html http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/18/c_132465115.htm (score: -0.1)
Sample 32: Yes for now but that whole Greek mess isn't going away anytime soon and could pose a problem for her re-election. The time frame for this question is quite long too. (score: -0.1)
Sample 33: Civic Platform already holds far more seats than any other party in the Polish parliament: 209, so one would fully expect it to maintain this relative position in the October elections. Polish politics have been volatile for years, so one cannot rule out an upset in which the Law and Justice Party, currently holding 166 seats, swings things around. However, the Civic Platform has been polling well in public opinion polls and seems poised to actually increase its lead over other parties, perhaps to the point where it can govern in its own right instead of, as at present, in coalition with the Polish People's Party with its 31 seats. (score: -0.1)
Sample 34: Referendum looks likely to pass right now, according to latest polls. Question is  will the vote take place before October? Rumor has it that it will be in May or June.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 35: I'm going to take a more extreme position here because, according to this article, Ukrainian courts have a 99.5% conviction rate. Though Tymoshenko's celebrity status may help, people seem to think the evidence is stacked against her and that high base rate of convictions seems tough to ignore. (score: -0.1)
Sample 36: Very unlikely to happen soon especially after UK expelled Iranian diplomats on 12/2 (score: -0.1)
Sample 37: I don't believe the F-16s matter one bit. this is all about domestic politics. This seems unlikely. (score: -0.1)
Sample 38: It is at 4.29 today (1-25). It would not take much to meet the condition, even if Chavez does not devalue it as planned (score: -0.1)
Sample 39: Latest economic news for Italy  (1-25) is terrible. Doubtful that whoever is PM will be able to stop rise in bond rates.  (score: -0.1)
Sample 40: I think this is a pretty difficult question.  Key factors that I would need information on to make a good assessment:  1. Who has release authority for chem/bio weapons?   2. Is there a difference in the decision-making calculus of the regime between chem vs. bio?  3. What does the regime perceive to be the most likely follow-on/response actions taken by a target of the regime's WMD?  4. What kind of bio weapon delivery capabilities does the regime have?   I think the regime has such an upper hand against the FSA that they won't need to resort to chem weapons unless things go terribly south. I also wouldn't discount the regime's willingness to use them against an invading/foreign force if they feel like their backs are against the wall. I do think the threshold of use against a foreign force is higher since the repercussions might be worse than the possible benefit of using them. (score: -0.1)
Sample 41: Berlusconi can hardly lose re-election by 1 October when elections are not due until 2013. He has proved remarkably resilient in the face of accusations of scandalous behaviour and corruption and Italy is not in robust condition politically, so it would seem highly unlikely that he will be dislodged in this short time frame. However, just conceivably, there is some grave scandal lurking in the wings that could suddenly surface, prove the final straw in terms of his reputation and bring him down. (score: -0.1)
Sample 42: Ortega holds such a clear lead over his rivals and has such a well honed political machine behind him that his election looks almost certain. (score: -0.1)
Sample 43: Taliban has no motive to negotiate, since US is scheduled to pull out and Karzai government will probably collapse as soon as they do. They expect (rightly) to win, so why settle? Also, Obama cannot afford to negotiate with "terrorists" in election year, as Republicans will crucify him for it. (score: -0.0)
Sample 44: Following teammates
 
 Another data point is that over the last year the TOPIX Index has stayed in a range of just over 200 points.
 
 I agree that the economic slow down after the sales tax hike is troubling for this question. (score: -0.0)
Sample 45: there is no real reason for the US to use drones beyond al-Qaeda (worries about civilian casualties. I just don't see any US impulse to help catch him (score: -0.0)
Sample 46: According to news stories, they are talking now, and making progress on deal. Whether whatever  agreement they make will actually bring peace is another issue (score: -0.0)
Sample 47: I am far from convinced that Iran wants any talks. It depends on how well the economic sanctions are working to squeeze the Iranian govt. May take more time to get them to the table.  (score: -0.0)
Sample 48: Russia says it will allow this rate.
 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/exchange-rate-volatility-won-t-deter-russia-from-floating-ruble/506319.html
 
 Looking at the chart, the change is entirely feasible. http://mobile.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR
 
 Main risk is that sanctions will temporarily tank the exchange rate. Hedging slightly for this. (score: -0.0)
Sample 49: I'm guessing the March  2012 invitation did not qualify. An official announcement from NK would likely be posted here: http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm although it would probably be reported in SK press first.  Six month time horizon on this question. I see this as mostly unlikely, but more likely if the US food aid program starts back up since that represents a thaw in relations. (score: 0.0)
Sample 50: We have nearly a full year so there is a better than even chance, but with China & North Korea relations souring it feels less likely than I normally would expect.
 
 Alternatively North Korea is improving relations with Russia, but it doesn't seem in either parties interest to make such a public display any time soon either.
 
 Thanks for the background timing Devyn.
 As always there is a lot of wildcard around North Korea, especially given the traditional secrecy around trips to China. (score: 0.0)

Sample 52: One hesitates to express certainty, but it has never to my knowledge been envisaged that Serbia would enter the EU before 2014 at the earliest and present circumstances do not seem propitious, given the parlous state of EU finances. The key players would surely not want to take on board another small state while saddled with the problems of Greece, Portugal and Spain. (score: 0.0)

Sample 54: I'm shading yes on this. WTO ruled against China on export of metal ores in 2011 and the time horizon for this question is quite long. Brian is right that there are some administrative hurdles for this question but there's more than a year for the question to resolve.

Sample 58: The talks with Russia have dragged on for quite a while and there are complicating factors which suggest that no breakthrough is imminent or likely to be achieved by the end of 2011. The visit by David Cameron is, perhaps, a positive sign, but the political uncertainties in Russia, the moribund state of the Doha round due to intractable disagreements over agricultural subsidies and that fact that agricultural commodity access and safety standards are a chief bone of contention between the US and Russia over the latter's WTO accession bid suggest that we are not yet at a breakthrough point.

Here are some forecasters' reationales for their predictions. I want to understand what features are important for accurate forecasts.
We want to understand what kind of text samples achieve a higher score, so please suggest descriptions about the text samples that are more likely to achieve higher scores.
Please suggest me at most 5 descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes "". Each of them needs to be a predicate about a text followed by an explanation and an example that satisfies the predicate, for example:
- "uses double negation; specifically, there is a sentence in the text that uses negation twice. For example, 'the pilot did not never had an accident'"
- "has a conservative stance; specifically, the overall text exhibits a conservative political stance (e.g. pro-life, deregulation, etc). For example, 'Fetus is sentient so we should not abort.'"
Do not output anything else. Please do not mention score in your example. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)

Please generate the response based on the given datapoints as much as possible. We want the descriptions to be relatively objective and can be validated easily, e.g. "is surprising" means different things for different people, so we want to avoid such descriptions. It should also be a predicate on a single text (rather than a statement about a comparison); for example, instead of saying "uses more polite language", the generation should be "uses polite language". Sometimes KeyInfo is provided to help you make come up with better responses (though it might also be unavailable).
