        "In the past year (trailing twelve months), there have been 15 trade disputes. 7 of the 15 disputes in the past twelve months have targeted the EU, Canada, or the US. Historically, the majority of disputes have been against the EU and the US.\n \n The Russian Federation has initiated a pair of trade disputes with the EU, which were reciprocated by the EU. The Russian Federation has not initiated a dispute with Canada or the United States during the past twelve month period.\n \n Looking back at historical information of disputes by country, it appears as if the Russian Federation has only ever initiated two disputes, being the aforementioned against the EU.\n \n Russia's complaint regarding the EU's energy sector measures were filed back on April 30, 2014. Most likely this filing will cover the basis for limiting energy trade with Russia. This area seems to be the most sensitive between the Russia and EU, as Russia's energy exports are significant portion of their GDP. \n \n As of 2012, oil and gas sector accounted for 16% of the GDP, 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports. Russian oil and natural gas are their chief export to the EU, the largest consumer of these products. These stats seem to indicate that the Russians are heavily dependent on EU consumption and demand for their energy products.\n \n In summary, it seems unlikely that the Russian Federation will initiate a WTO dispute against the EU, Canada, or the US given its past track record of sparse disputes. Furthermore, the most sensitive area of the Russian economy and most likely source of a dispute is already on the table for the EU, the largest consumer of Russian energy products. The potential weakness in the analysis lies within the nature of WTO trade disputes and processes for filing and maintaining or escalating a dispute. More work should be performed in this area prior to following the analysis.\n  \n \n http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_status_e.htm\n \n http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_by_country_e.htm\n \n http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds476_e.htm\n \n http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=RS\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Russia",

Most of these clashes would not meet the criteria set out in this question though, as these incidents have been limited to confrontations between domestic law enforcement agencies (primarily the coast guard) and fishermen. \n \n Given the low baseline for military-to-miitary clashes in the South China Sea, I don't think its likely that we will see a planned military engagement in the South China Sea before June 2015.

The Economist's reviewer writes:\n \n <blockquote>Most alarming is the fact that the sea has become the theatre for a battle of nerves between China and America. China believes America is encouraging the littoral states to stand up to it over its territorial claims, and bitterly resents America's insistence that it has the right to send its spy ships to the edge of China's territorial waters, 22km off its coast. American power depends on the freedom of navigation, both for its navy and for commercial traffic through the sea. The South China Sea has become the test of America's strategic \"rebalancing\" towards Asia and of its willingness to protect its friends and allies from Chinese bullying. As Mr Hayton sombrely notes: <b>\"The logic is towards conflict.\"</b>\n \n The author adds, however, that in the final stage of his research he changed his mind. When Mr Hayton began working on his book, he believed that some kind of conflict over the sea was imminent. He subsequently became convinced that Chinese leaders understand they would lose a shooting war and are desperate to avoid it, using instead what they call \"the period of strategic opportunity\" to build up China's strength. Since they know the other side must grasp this, however, they have to appear belligerent. This is an intriguing argument. But <b>this strategy is so vulnerable to miscalculation, misperception and sheer bad luck, that it is not a very reassuring one</b>. [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n \n It looks to be a toss-up.",

We've learned from him that we cannot rely on travelers to be honest at airport/customs checks about their medical and travel histories.  It appears that Duncan lied to officials about his exposure history when leaving Liberia, and indeed the Liberian president has threatened to prosecute him for this.  Indeed, there have been suggestions that Duncan knew there was a good chance he was infected, and deliberately traveled to the US so as to be in a position to receive superior treatment in the event he became symptomatic. \n \n 2. There are many more commercial flights between West Africa and Europe than between West Africa and America.  (Note that Duncan himself flew to the US via Brussels.)  With the possible exception of Liberia, West African countries have closer cultural ties to Europe than North America.  That means that someone who fears exposure but has the means to travel to the West before becoming symptomatic to seek treatment, is more likely to go to Europe than the US.  European countries are also more likely to render treatment at low cost, thanks to national health care systems. All this means that Europe may be a magnet for future Mr. Duncans.\n \n 3. Western countries have (inexplicably) shown little desire to restrict entry by persons with visas issued in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, or whose trips originate from those countries.  (And yes, it should be possible for Homeland Security to know the origin of airline passengers who change planes at hubs.)  The doors are open.\n \n 4. Then there is the issue of European medical personnel and journalists returning home. As we know, several American aid workers, and an NBC cameraman, caught Ebola in Africa.  They were also diagnosed in Africa, which does not count towards this question.

To meet debt-reduction targets, the country must make significant efforts annually, something Italy is very slow to accept, he explained. \"In order to do that, the effort of structural adjustment should have been equal to half a percentage point of gross domestic product (GDP),\" said Rehn. \"Instead, it's only 0.1%,\" he added.\"  This sums up the problem, but wait, there is more, \"To be eligible for this investment clause, the country must come up with a debt-payment plan judged sufficient to put Italy on a declining debt-to-GDP ratio. At more than two trillion euros, a figure exceeding 130% of GDP, Italy's public debt is second in the eurozone only to that of Greece. Rehn said the EU will assess Italy's fiscal progress and make a final decision on the investment clause in February 2014.\"  The article goes on to say that although Italy is trying by making attempts in policy to correct the problem only time will tell, and they may not make the February deadline to be granted the status for which they seek.",

This allows Western leaders to respond weakly while still saving face, whereas more aggressive actions would almost demand a more forceful response. Whatever additional benefits Russia would receive from annexing the rebel-held areas would likely be outweighed by the negative ramifications of embracing the role of aggressor. \n \n A scenario in which Russia does annex the separatist regions could unfold if the Ukrainian army goes back on the offensive and attempts to retake the Eastern regions, causing heavy damage and civilian casualties in the process. Then, Russia could more justifiably intervene militarily; either under the pretext of humanitarian/peacekeeping purposes, or unofficially, as they did recently when the Ukrainian army came close to encircling Donetsk.",

        "I likely need to read up on this - but my immediately reaction is that it does not make sense. \n \n There are two reasons why PBOC has entered into swap agreements:\n 1. To pave the way towards making the RMB part of the SDR.\n 2. To allow countries (e.g. Russia) to enter into trade with China without requiring USD.\n \n Clearly, (2) is not a reason for US to enter into a swap agreement - US is the \"reserve\" currency and the currency of trade. \n \n So I think the main reason for a currency swap agreement would be for RMB to become part of the SDR. But it makes sense for China to enter into a swap arrangement with non US central banks because the RMB is not yet freely tradable, and the RMB is closely linked with the USD. I don't see how a swap arrangement with US helps in this regard - the simpler mechanism is to simply make the RMB float. And as we have seen, PBOC does not yet appear ready to make this change. SO I deem this possibility as low.\n \n There is a third possibility.  In the financial crisis, the Fed entered into currency swap agreements with the ECB because of the severe dollar shortage in European banks. But again I don't see this happening with China.\n \n There may be other reasons -  I will need to do some research on it.",
        "On 17 October 2013, the South Korean military asked the Pentagon to provide information on the THAAD system. Information of the system concerned prices and capabilities as part of efforts to strengthen defenses against North Korean ballistic missiles.

According to some media reports the US is pressuring Seoul to do so instead of developing their own national missile defense system. Russia has expressed concerns about this however Washington has brushed aside Moscow's concerns that the deployment would have an impact on regional stability, saying the system is not aimed against Russia.\n \n Reports have surfaced that South Korea has decided it will develop its own indigenous long-range surface-to-air missile instead of buying the THAAD.\n \n Kim Jong-un has been busy with purging any threats to his leadership, and with this process supposedly complete it's time for more displays of \"might\" to bolster his image both internally & externally. Given the history it is apparent that the DPRK are working towards weaponizing long range missile technology. It's a matter of time before it becomes a reality that the DPRK has this technology.\n \n Given the details in the \"More Info/Clarifications\" tab I think that unless there is an escalation by the DPRK in the near future then South Korea will continue the development of their own technology & resist agreeing to the deployment of the THAAD system. If there is a sudden escalation though then South Korea might agree to a loan of THAAD for the short term until their technology development is complete.",

        "EU public opinion is more strongly in favour of privacy protection than US's, particularly with regard to commercial organizations' data. While big US cloud providers want improvements from Obama on currently almost non-existent legal protection for non-American from American government surveillance, they also want trade negotiations to exempt them from (some of existing) European data protection. EU is actually in the midst of canning the Safe Harbour Agreement as not sufficiently strong on protecting privacy. So that is not promising in terms of seeing a trade agreement in short term.   On the other hand, Germany and France toned down their public rhetoric about spying from initial white heat levels, saying they needed to see concrete actions by summer of 2014 from US. One carrot that US could offer is to provide them as large important allies some of the access, tools or other benefits of the US Intelligence Community that other members of the Five Eyes get (ie UK, Australia, Canada, NZ). It's unclear whether this will be enough to mollify existing continental European outrage, or actually lead to an agreement. Both sides seem very engaged, and wanting to come to some agreement, so the atmospherics are positive.  Germany's three large telcos are building systems to allow all of the Internet traffic between German points to stay inside the country by 2015 in order to provide it with legal protection of German law. Many commentators in EU have spoken of opportunity of an ICT industrial policy to spur domestic cloud provider industry as one way to address lack of adequate privacy with US cloud providers.  News reports have Obama's response to Snowden's revelations coming out Jan 17 as including increased protections for foreigners. This would set the stage for an agreement with EU on its basis. However, there was odd fuzziness in the 5 experts report to Obama on how much protection foreigners currently have at US law (despite Cass Sunstein's participation).

For each of the 64 trading days after the first, I calculated the ratios r=P(t)/P(t-1) and 1/r=P(t-1)/P(t).

In 1,572 of these, the simulated closing price was at or below 1200 on at least day.

        "ABSTRACT: There does not appear to be any support in the Iraqi government for Kurdish demands to stay within Iraq, as their demands for staying in are way too extreme. Kurdish ethnic cleansing in the disputed areas that they occupied also indicate that Kurdistan is not sincere in negotiations and are more interested in seizing territory. The only people that MIGHT support their federalist demands, the Sunnis, have pulled out of talks with the Iraqi government.\n \n While a lot of countries are opposed to Kurdistan's independence referendum, it's hard to see what would convince Kurdistan to reduce their federalist demands to something that might be acceptable to Iraq. Kurdistan plans to hold a referendum in late 2014.\n ---\n REASONING:\n On one hand, Al Araibya[1] claims that the referendum will happen some time in late 2014, though it still needs to be scheduled. The Kurdish people support independence, and they see an opportunity to gain that independence with the current chaos in Iraq.\n \n On the other hand, the only people actually wanting independence are the Kurds (and maybe the Turks, since the Turks has economic connections to Kurdistan). Literally nobody else wants Kurdish independence, and the US has came out strongly against it. Since Kurdistan is relying heavily on US backing, it has to be able to pull back from all this \"independence\" talk.\n \n The Kurds claim that they are willing to stay in Iraq only if Iraq agrees to a strong federalism plan that would, according to the New York Times[2], grant it \"the right to sell their own oil, buy their own arms and conduct referendums on whether disputed areas should join the Kurdish region, as well as the establishment of a new mechanism to prevent any \"abuses of power\" by the new leadership in Baghdad\". The Americans are scoffing at these demands as the Kurds demanding \"de facto\" independence.\n \n On a side note, conducting referendums on the disputed areas is almost entirely a stupid demand, considering that both the Sunni Arabs and Shia Arabs agree that the disputed areas should NOT fall into Kurdish hands. In fact, this may have been the reason why the Kurds militarily invaded some of those disputed regions, such as Kirkuk, as the Arabs resisted any attempt at a referendum in those regions. But I have a hard time thinking the Arabs will happily accept Kurdish military aggression, so if the Kurds is serious about negotiation, they might have to withdraw its forces from those disputed regions. TIME reports, however, that the Kurds are already in the process of ethnically cleansing the disputed areas[3]. So I think the Kurds are more interested in securing more territory for their state than they are in reaching a peace deal with Baghdad.\n \n Now the Sunnis would like the idea of strong federalism plan themselves, as they did not like the previous Maliki regime and wanted to contain it. So the Sunnis might be able to accept Kurdish demands if it would also help them gain their own \"de facto\" statelet. However, the Sunnis has just recently pulled out of talks with the Shia government following an attack on a major Sunni masjid[4]. The Sunnis believe that the the attack was orchestrated by Shia militants. Until the Sunnis return to the negotiating table, it's hard to see what sort of progress can be done in talks. In fact, if the Sunnis' allegations are true, then it's an important indication that the the Iraqi government CANNOT compromise with the Kurdistan, lest it upset its more militant elements.\n \n There's a possibility that some Sunni militants may rebel against the Islamic State on their own, without reconciling with the Iraqi government first, but such a rebellion may only lead to more chaos in the region, which would bolster the argument for Kurdish secession. Kurdistan would have protect themselves from all militants, IS or not.\n \n [1]http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/2014/08/18/-Soft-federation-is-Abadi-s-best-bet-to-keep-Kurds-within-Iraq.html\n [2]http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/30/world/middleeast/iraqi-kurds-expand-autonomy-as-isis-reorders-the-landscape.html\n [3]http://time.com/3182347/kurds-sunni-arabs-iraq-isis-erbil/\n [4]http://rt.com/news/182184-iraq-shia-sunni-shooting/",

        "I would have posted on the Forum page first, but I need to get this done and go to bed.  The question is not if China will declare a 2nd ADIZ, but when.  I've listed some evidence for and against below.  I think the crucial deciding factor for another Chinese ADIZ is the deployment of their new subs.\n \n \n Reasons China creates a new ADIZ:\n \n - A partial South China Sea ADIZ around Hainan would help protect its new \n nuclear missile-capable submarines from U.S. surveillance.\n \n    \"A likely target of the U.S. surveillance is China's submarine fleet operating from a base in southern Hainan island, the military experts said. Among the submarines using the base are large Jin-class vessels capable of carrying nuclear-armed ballistic missiles that are expected to form a key plank in China's nuclear deterrence strategy.  The precise operational readiness of China's three or four Jin-class vessels, including their missile launching capabilities, is not publicly known, military analysts said.\n    \"Long-term, these submarines are China's only hope for a meaningful deterrence ... they are everything to China,\" said Zhang Baohui, a mainland security specialist at Hong Kong's Lingnan University and author of a forthcoming book on Beijing's nuclear strategy and forces.\"\n \n    \"In an incident on Aug. 19, a Chinese fighter jet flew within 20 feet of a U.S. P-8 Poseidon submarine surveillance aircraft near [i.e., southeast of] Hainan, and rolled to expose its weapons to the pilot, Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said. The U.S. plane was in international airspace..., Kirby said.\"\n \n    \"A report in the Global Times claimed the P-8 had dropped a sonar buoy [to track submarines] from its undercarriage, triggering the interception.\"\n \n - A partial South China Sea ADIZ around Hainan would be more within the capabilities of the Chinese military to patrol and enforce.\n \n    \"A U.S. defense official said the Chinese pilot [that conducted the interdept] was from the same Hainan unit that appeared to be responsible for other encounters in March, April and May, part of what he called a rising trend of 'nonstandard, unprofessional and unsafe' intercepts of U.S. aircraft since the end of 2013.\n \n \n Reasons China does not create a new ADIZ:\n \n - The U.S. has already publicly warned China not to establish a South China Sea ADIZ (first during Secretary of State Kerry's January 2013 visit to the Philippines).\n \n    \"We have been very clear with the Chinese that we would see that (setting of another ADIZ) as a provocative and destabilizing development that would result in changes in our presence and military posture in the region,\" [Evan] Medeiros [senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council] said.\"\n \n - An ADIZ around Hainan would escalate already tense confrontations between Chinese and U.S. military aircraft. \n \n    \"Setting up an air defense zone near Hainan, which could require aircraft to file flight plans with Chinese authorities, would be a direct challenge to U.S. forces, which routinely conduct surveillance exercises in the area of the Yalong Bay Naval Base. The U.S. flew B-52 bombers through China's East China Sea air zone days after it was announced. \n \n - A partial South China Sea ADIZ around Hainan would heighten regional tensions.\n \n    \"'The key question is in the timing and means by which this is announced by China,' said Andrew Scobell, a senior political scientist at RAND Corporation in Arlington, Virginia, referring to a potential partial South China Sea air zone. 'Such an announcement would likely heighten alarm among Southeast Asian states and the U.S.'\"\n    \"'It is not clear whether Beijing has learned the lessons of its earlier announcement of the East China Sea ADIZ,' he said. Scobell said he expects China to establish a zone over some of the South China Sea in the near future.\"\n \n    \"Announcing an air zone across the entire South China Sea would be complicated as it would directly affect more countries in the area, according to retired Major General Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser at Beijing-based research group the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association. Countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei also claim part of the waters, through which some of the world's busiest shipping lanes run.\n \n - The Chinese military would be unable to patrol and enforce a large South China Sea ADIZ.\n \n    \"The exact size of the ADIZ is also important in terms of China's ability to enforce the rules it establishes. The ... [Chinese] Air Force (PLAAF) lacks enough aircraft with sufficient range to effectively enforce an ADIZ further out in the South China Sea, making it much easier for even smaller nations to openly defy China's regulations. By contrast, a smaller ADIZ might give the PLAAF a better chance of making the ADIZ more than just Beijing staking a future claim to the area.\"\n \n \n Indicators for a new China ADIZ\n \n - Public announcements by current/former senior U.S. military/civilian Department of Defense (DoD) personnel and/or defense policy organizations.\n \n    \"[In] remarks made by U.S. Captain James Fanell, director of intelligence and information operations at the US Pacific Fleet, at a recent [Feb 13, 2014?] U.S. Naval Institute conference, ...Fanell...predicted that China would establish an ADIZ in the South China Sea by 2015 at the latest.\"\n \n - Public announcements by current/former senior Chinese military personnel and/or defense policy organizations.\n \n    \"China's efforts to protect its submarine gateway to the South China Sea could broaden from standoffs with U.S. military planes to announcing an air defense identification zone, according to two retired army officers.\n China could seek to restrict the air space around Hainan Island as the U.S. routinely runs surveillance flights in the area, retired Colonel Yue Gang said. The move would mirror a zone China set up in November over portions of the East China Sea disputed with Japan.\n    \"Although it's premature to set up an air zone over the entire South China Sea at this moment, it makes sense to build a partial zone covering the waters near Hainan where China's biggest nuclear submarine base is located,\" Yue said. Encompassing air space deemed international by the U.S. and by China as being within its exclusive economic zone, it would draw \"red lines\" for U.S. military flights.\n \n    \"A senior researcher and officer in China's People's Liberation Army said that establishing an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) is essential to China's national interest. 'The establishment of another ADIZ over the South China Sea is necessary for China's long-term national interest, Senior Colonel Li Jie, a researcher at the PLA Navy's Military Academy and frequent media commentator, said on [Feb 21, 2014].\n \n    \"'Beijing will exercise caution in launching a South China Sea ADIZ,' [retired Major General Xu Guangyu] said. 'But it will be a matter of time. China's air defense space won't be just confined to the East China Sea.'\"\n \n    \"...following the implementation of the East China Sea ADIZ, Chinese defense spokesman Yang Yujun, in a question and answer session on November 23, 2013, said that 'China will establish other Air Defense Identification Zones at the right moment after necessary preparations are completed.'\"\n \n \n Indicators against a new China ADIZ\n \n - Public announcements by Chinese civilian government officials.\n \n    \"In response to reports by Japan's Asahi Shimbun that a South China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) was imminent, following on the heels of the East China Sea ADIZ, China has accused Japan of spreading rumors. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei, in a press release quoted by Xinhua, stated that 'We sternly warned these forces not to mislead public opinions with rumors and play up tensions for their own selfish benefit.'\"\n \n    \"[The foreign ministry statement] could indicate a rift between Chinese foreign ministry officials and their defense counterparts-the original indication that China would pursue additional air defense zones came from a defense ministry spokesman.\"\n \n    \"For the moment, the Chinese foreign ministry's willingness to address an unconfirmed report by a Japanese newspaper is curious but it suggests that China might abstain from a South China Sea ADIZ in the short term.\"\n \n \n Sources:\n \n \"China Seeks to Protect South China Sea Submarine Gateway,\" Bloomberg,\n By Ting Shi, Aug 28, 2014 11:18 PM ET (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-28/china-seeks-to-better-protect-south-china-sea-submarine-gateway.html). \n \n \"Chinese interceptions of U.S. military planes could intensify due to submarine base,\" Reuters, By Greg Torode and Megha Rajagopalan,\n HONG KONG/BEIJING, Thu Aug 28, 2014 5:33pm EDT (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/28/us-china-usa-military-idUSKBN0GS2MZ20140828).\n \n \"China to defer establishment of South China Sea ADIZ,\" Asitimes,\n Sunday, April 6, 2014 (http://asitimes.blogspot.com/2014/04/china-to-defer-establishment-of-south.html).\n \n \"PLA Officer: China Must Establish South China Sea ADIZ,\" The Diplomat, by Zachary Keck, February 22, 2014 (http://thediplomat.com/2014/02/pla-officer-china-must-establish-south-china-sea-adiz/).\n \n \"Chinese Foreign Ministry: No South China Sea ADIZ,\" The Diplomat, By Ankit Panda, February 04, 2014 (http://thediplomat.com/2014/02/chinese-foreign-ministry-no-south-china-sea-adiz/).\n \n \"U.S. 'could change military posture' if China sets up second ADIZ,\" The Japan Times, Feb 1, 2014 (http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/02/01/national/u-s-could-change-military-posture-if-china-sets-up-second-adiz/).\n \n \"China's Drafting a South China Sea ADIZ: China reportedly began drawing up plans for a South China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone as early as May 2013,\" The Diplomat, by Zachary Keck, January 31, 2014 (http://thediplomat.com/2014/01/chinas-drafting-a-south-china-sea-adiz/).  \n \n \"Defense Spokesman Yang Yujun's Response to Questions on the Establishment of The East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone,\" Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of the Philippines Press Release, 2013/12/04 (http://ph.china-embassy.org/eng/xwfb/t1105388.htm).",

John Allen put it in reference to defeating IS, \"It could take years,\" http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/01/politics/allen-syria-training/\n \n And as is, the Sauds have been preparing for an attack from IS- they wouldn't fortify there border without good reason and expectation. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/10942680/Saudi-Arabia-sends-30000-troops-to-Iraq-border.html\n \n I'd leave a 10% unlikeliness for the off chance that the nations of the world realize the acuity of this threat and send in definitive ground forces soon.",

        "This is a tricky question. The idea of electing the Commission was born in early 2011 (!) but it has not yet been made reality due to political infighting. This infighting is actually a defining characteristic of the new Libya, as actors with various interests (regional, tribal, ideological or simply power interests) are competing and consensus is hard to achieve. Add to that really big problems with security and ever growing public resentment.  Nonetheless, the parliament finally adopted a law saying the 60 members commission will be elected by popular vote which is a significant step toward making it finally happen. Still, I see it as unlikely until 1 October. When law for general elections was adopted, it took the High National Election Commission 6 months to prepare the elections. And the newly-adopted law regarding Constitutional Commission is already disputed by Berbers and Tebou even if they really don't have much say.  So it is difficult to say. Despite all problems, previous elections were finally successfully organized and I assume this will happen also with the Commission. The question is when - till October? One factor speeding up the process might be the public discontent, i.e. the political actors might feel that they really have to do something. I also guess the High National Election Commission will be quicker with preparing voting lists and such as now it can draw on previous experience.  It is a relatively specific problem so I don't see a way how to establish even a rough base rate built on comparing with other countries which have faced similar problems. I would argue there is a within-case Libyan base rate when it comes to organizing such events as elections and it is more in favor of the forecast which says this will not happen until October. But it might. So I'm giving it now 30% but will follow it closely because e.g. one statement by important politician giving some estimate when the elections should take place would make the forecast much easier.  http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/04/04/gnc-stalemate-on-process-for-selecting-committee-of-60/ http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/07/20/amazigh-tebu-and-tuareg-threaten-boycott-of-constitutional-commission/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_General_National_Congress_election,_2012",

If THAAD is not deployed, (ii) seems more likely situation it occurs under, and would not function to defuse the situation. \n \n Question B removes the most obvious catalyst for a launch and requires us to ask, what else might ignite NK to launch? The pope visit was a mild and non-threatening act which resulted in a few short range missiles.  Odd that even  a non-threatening  dignitary visit provoked such a response.

For example, similar clashes along the India-Pakistan border that are much wider in scope have resulted in only limited casualties:\n \n \"Pakistani Rangers targeted 40 border out posts and 25 border hamlets by resorting to heavy mortar shelling and firing along the International Border in Jammu and Samba districts of Jammu and Kashmir, leaving three people injured, said a report published in The Times of India.\n \n \"Pakistani Rangers again resorted to unprovoked mortar shelling and heavy firing on BSF posts along the International Border (IB) since 2100 hours last night,\" Border Security Force (BSF) spokesman Vinood Yadav said on Tuesday.\n \n http://www.dawn.com/news/1136594\n \n 4)  Other reports link Jundallah to Saudi funding sources, which would be plausible in light of the ongoing maneuvering for primacy within the Gulf between Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Pakistan is unlikely to wish to alienate either party, given its economic ties to both countries, but has to perceive a step-down in hostilities with Iran as being of greater importance due to the possibility of escalation along a border the Pakistani military is not prepared to defend at present.\n \n \n When taken in total, the combination of these three factors leaves little room for the sort of large scale clash that would result in any one incident surpassing 15 lethal casualties.",

However, if no candidate receives the required number of votes (usually an absolute majority or 40-45% with a winning margin of 5-15%), then those candidates having less than a certain proportion of the votes, or all but the two candidates receiving the most votes, are eliminated, and a second round of voting occurs.\n \n Recent Data Folha polls have shown that Silva (21%) is likely to go to the run-off with Dilma (36%), as her percentages are higher than Aecio's (20%).[10] The fact that another party outside of PT and PSDB dominance might have the potential to be in the run-off of a presidential election would be historic.

According to our estimations, it aims at showing Moscow's cutting off cooperation with the NATO and flexing muscles. \n \n Practically, it duplicates the spirit of Kremlin's statement made on August 1, current year, when Moscow claimed to consider this treaty <<outdated>>.

Until now, it has refrained from responding in force to Russian actions, but it sent troops Saturday to surround the gas terminal, according to a Ukrainian news service quoting local police...

        "The last missile launch by North Korea http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/26/world/asia/north-korea-rodong-missile-launch/\n \n was of the Rodong (aka Nodong) a \"medium-range ballistic missile\".  According to (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_North_Korean_missile_tests), the Rodong is based on Scud, a Russian tactical ballistic missle.  The estimated range is 1000km.  This is well short of the 5700km to Alaska, 7500km to Hawaii, or 9550km to Los Angeles that would be necessary to meet the forecast definition of \"long-range missile\".\n \n http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/04/14/the-ultimate-north-korean-missile-threat-to-america-a-nuke-power-grid-attack/\n \n describes a \"medium range Musudan\" missiles underdevelopment with estimated range of 2500km, still below the distance required to reach continental US, Alaska or Hawaii.\n \n Finally, in Dec 2012 North Korea launched the Unha-3 rocket and apparently place a (dead) satellite into orbit. This rocket could reach the US as stated:  http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/world/asia/north-korean-rocket-had-military-purpose-seoul-says.html?_r=0 \"ballistic missile that could fly more than 6,200 miles, with a warhead of about 1,100 to 1,300 pounds, putting the West Coast of the United States in range.\"  Although some conflicting sites list the range as 4160 miles, that still brings Hawaii and Alaska into range.\n \n So while North Korea apparently has demonstrated the technology for a long-range missile, they haven't utilized one since Dec. of 2012, instead using shorter range missiles as a means of sending a message to the world. So a combination of the difficulty in launching a long range missile, combined with the ability to meet the short term goals of \"messaging\" with short and medium term missiles, leads one to believe the logical step would be for N Korea to continue with the recent pattern.  Therefore I would estimate a low probability of a positive outcome for this question.\n \n However, North Korea (and Kim Jong Un) is notoriously unpredictable in both leadership changes, nuclear program developments, and military actions.  Arguably, a perceived provocation, such as South Korea's use of THAAD missile defense would increase the probability of a more meaningful missile test.  As a pure dictorship, Kim Jong-Un alone can make the decision, making evaluation of potential outcomes risky, as his tenure has been market by multiple aggressive military actions.  For that reason I raised the outcomes under b) from 10% to 20% to account for this wildcard action.\n ",

        "Starting on the lower end with a bias to go lower.\n \n The last time OPEC cuts quotas was in 2008, and every six months there's rumbings that they will make cuts (the did boost when Iraq rejoined the fold in 2012). Instead, a lot of them keep overproducing. They haven't even been able to agree on a replacement general secretary since 2012. Discipline in OPEC isn't what it used to be.\n http://online.wsj.com/articles/opec-ministers-agree-to-maintain-output-quota-1402485387\n \n IEA says it expects no cuts. Saudi Arabia is signaling it will again resist cuts and is ok with lower prices, at least officially. Instead, partly to counter new competition from Nigeria in Asia (which now exports zero to the US), among others, Saudi Arabia unilaterally cut prices last month and Iran followed suit this month.\n http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/58d6d65a-537a-11e4-929b-00144feab7de.html\n http://www.nasdaq.com/article/crude-falls-as-opec-seen-leaving-quotas-unchanged-cm401478\n http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4355edac-53ac-11e4-8285-00144feab7de.html\n \n Consumption growth looks to be sluggish lately but I think the bigger driver in the price plunge is more supply. US is at multi-decade highs, upending global oil markets. OPEC is highest in a year. Supply disruptions have eased, notably from Libya. There's also a feedback effect from the stronger dollar: most commodities are priced in dollars, so stronger USD means weaker commodity prices.\n \n I've seen a few theories about what the Saudis are up to: undercut North American shale oil fracking/oil sands (unpersuasive methinks), put pressure on Russia (a fringe benefit), or strongarm other OPEC countries and secure market share (my vote).\n \n According to the IEA, 98% of US fracking is still profitable at $80 (dropping to 82% at $60). OPEC members have much lower production costs (around $20) but rely on oil to fund their social spending. The fiscal breakeven varies a lot. Saudi Arabia's is around $93 but apparently they can take $80. But fiscal breakeven for most all of OPEC is above current prices, with Iran at $140. Venezuela is at $121 and just called for an emergency OPEC meeting lest there be a price war. Meanwhile, Russia was at $117 even before the sanctions and higher social outlays.\n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/13/us-shaleoil-energy-breakeven-idUSKCN0I21GG20141013\n http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/15/opec-budget-idUKL6N0QL1VY20140815\n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/15/us-markets-oil-production-analysis-idUSKCN0I40CP20141015\n http://www.platts.com/latest-news/oil/london/saudis-boost-output-as-oil-price-slumps-venezuela-21377026\n http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-14/russia-must-cut-break-even-oil-price-to-80-citigroup-says-2-.html\n \n So I suspect what we're seeing is the fallout from ongoing internecine battles with OPEC. It'll be worth watching for any signs that they can agree on a replacement general secretary. If they can do that, then maybe the odds of quota cuts go up. \n \n My best guess is also that we're near the lows for oil anyway. Even a modest rise will reduce the pressure for quota cuts. \n ",

Finally, the new administration also has an interest in sending a clear message to China and Russia who frequently and increasingly have been invading Japan's airspace--this is particularly timely considering China's release of it's stealth jet last January. For all these reasons, I think there is a good chance that the new administration will spend some of it's political capital on this project right away. ",

        "Thanks to Hawksridge for starting this problem.\n \n For the present, I'm forecasting a low chance of Ebola appearing in an EU country.  This could certainly change as time progresses.  \n \n I'm listing the case against the spread first.  Then I'm doing a 'premortem', which is the opposite of a postmortem.  It's a technique where I imagine that it's June 1st, 2015, and my prediction has turned out wrong.  I'll then try to determine what potentially could have been wrong in my forecast. This will help me monitor events if Ebola becomes out of control.\n \n \n The bottom line: Most medical experts believe the chance of Ebola spreading out of West Africa is very, very low.\n  \n  \n Quote: \"'The big question is whether sick people are going to get on a plane and spread the disease.' That answer, [the doctor] has found, depends largely on two factors: How many people are infected, and the degree of travel from the outbreak area.\" Most of the infected areas are not close to an international airport.  And almost all airports in West Africa are not major air hubs that connect to other central air traffic transit points.\n \n But even if an infected person [note: incubating the disease but not ill] flies on a plane to an international destination, the odds of fellow passengers catching the virus are extremely low.  Ebola doesn't pass easily from person to person. \"'Transmission requires very close contact with bodily fluids, like blood or mucus,' [the doctor] says. 'You need prolonged contact with somebody.'\"  Several doctors point out this is exactly the opposite of other diseases, such as a virulent influenza outbreak.  \n \n There are historical cases of people with Ebola who traveled by air and did not infect anyone else on the plane.  Also, people with full-blown Ebola would be too sick to travel.\n \n \n PREMORTEM:\n \n OFFICIAL EBOLA ESTIMATES WERE TOO LOW/PROJECTED CASES GREW FASTER THAN EXPECTED; INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO HALT DISEASE BEFORE PANDEMIC\n \n The longer the epidemic goes on without effective external intervention, the likelihood that total number of cases increases, and so does the risk of international spread.  If the outbreak is not contained in time, hundreds of thousands of people could be infected in three months.\n \n \"The World Health Organization (WHO) is using an educated guess of 20,000 cases before the end, in order to plan the scale of the response.  But the true potential of the outbreak is unknown and the WHO figure has been described to me as optimistic by some scientists.\"  Conservatively, other estimates state the laboratory-confirmed case count is threefold below the actual number of people infected, which could put an estimate of today's caseload as high as 15,000 cumulative, perhaps 12,000 actively infected.\n \n \"Officially the World Health Organization is saying the outbreak can be contained in six to nine months. But that is based on getting the resources to tackle the outbreak, which are currently stretched too thinly to contain Ebola as it stands.\"  Without effective intervention now, many experts predict there could be up to 250,000 people cumulatively infected in West Africa in 90 days.\n \n \n \"Not a single reported Ebola case has made the leap from the West African outbreak to the United States or Europe - or Asia or Australia. Only two nations, Senegal and Nigeria, have seen any Ebola cases slip out of the virus's hot zone centered on Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Maintaining this lucky streak will only get more difficult - and soon impossible - as the outbreak grows exponentially.\n \n \"[One] Ebola model is run by Dirk Brockmann at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin. His team found that the probability, for example, that an infected person will board a flight from Freetown, Sierra Leone, and arrive in the United Kingdom is about 7 percent. For the United States, it's 1.5 percent. Those odds might sound high, but as Brockmann explains, they mean that 67 infected individuals would need to board a plane for one of them to reach the United States. 'This is indeed small,' Brockmann said. The problem is that the odds are getting lower. The lucky streak can not continue if the epidemic is not brought under control.\" [NOTE: COMPARISON CLASS]\n \n EBOLA COULD BE TRANSMITTED FROM AN AFRICAN HOTSPOT VIA DIRECT FLIGHTS TO EUROPE\n \n \"'The chance of Ebola spreading out of West Africa is very, very low,' says infectious disease specialist  Karman Khan, with St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. 'But if it did spread, Paris is probably the first city on the list.'\"\n \n \"The major city affected by the Ebola outbreak is Conakry, Guinea, home to about a million people and an international airport. But it's not a central hub, like Hong Kong International Airport or Chicago O'Hare.\n \n 'The volume of travel in the Conakry airport is low,' Khan says. \"Most of the flights are local. But 10 percent of the traffic goes to Paris.' That would make Paris the likeliest place for Ebola to arrive.\"\n \n CASES MULTIPLIED IN NIGERIA, AND EBOLA SPREAD TO AT LEAST 30 OTHER NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD\n \n \"At this moment, ...Ebola spillover has resulted in infection...in Nigeria (two distinct clusters of connected cases). ... If this expands, the spread of Ebola inside Nigeria, particularly in Lagos - a city with a population of approximately 22 million - would put the world's epidemic into completely uncharted territory.\"\n \n DESPITE THE LOW PROBABILITY, EBOLA MUTATED TO A MORE TRANSMITTABLE, LESS DEADLY FORM\n \n \"[One doctor's] concern is that the virus is being given its first major opportunity to adapt to thrive in people, due to the large number of human-to-human transmissions of the virus during this outbreak of unprecedented scale.\"\n \n \"Ebola virus has a high rate of mutation and with mutation comes the possibility of adapting.\n \n [The doctor] argues:  'It is increasing exponentially and the fatality rate seems to be decreasing, but why?\n \n Is it better medical care, earlier intervention or is the virus adapting to humans and becoming less pathogenic? As a virologist that's what I think is happening.'\"\n \n \"There is a relationship between how deadly a virus is and how easily it spreads. Generally speaking if a virus is less likely to kill you, then you are more likely to spread it - although smallpox was a notable exception.\n \n [The doctor] said 'it really wouldn't surprise me' if Ebola adapted, the death rate fell to around 5% and the outbreak never really ended.\"\n \n \n \"Luck has kept Ebola out of the U.S. But that's very likely to change.\", Washington Post, By Todd C.

        "http://www.payvand.com/news/15/mar/1011.html\n \n Apparently there is still a lot of confusion as to whether this poor man has a qualified attorney, or one who is a puppet.\n \n The judge assigned to the case, Judge Salavati is notorious in Iran for leading numerous controversial trials, including many that have resulted in execution. He is considered one of those that are involved in a crackdown on journalists in Iran. Salavati has not allowed Jason's choice of attorney, Masoud Shafii, to try the case, nor even to meet with Jason. Salavati set a deadline of March 2nd for Jason to present an \"acceptable\" attorney.  The family said Leila Ahsan, who represents Jason's wife Yeganeh (Salehi), will now be Jason's lead attorney.\n \n Charges have still not been made public, or disclosed to Jason.  There has been no date set for trial.\n \n http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/11/jason-rezaian-family-journalist-iran-prison\n Jason's family is trying to raise awareness of his plight.  The National Press club is holding a news conference tomorrow in San Diego to host talks about this case.  Jason was the bureau chief for the Washington Post there in Iran.  The WP is considered a somewhat liberal paper.\n \n http://www.multichannel.com/news/retransmission-content/republicans-seeks-release-journalist-jailed-iran/388742\n On the other front, our senate has asked John Kerry and President Obama, to include Jason's case in the nuclear negotiations.  They believe we should not even be negotiating if there are American prisoners in Iranian captivity. Currently there are three.  Whether Kerry and Obama will throw this into the mix is not certain.  The Senate does not seem to understand that it isn't just the USA negotiating this deal.  And, let us not forget that Jason is a dual citizen Iranian/US, so I'm sure he is a very special case there in Iran.  I'm pretty sure they see this as one of their own citizens stepping out of line, no matter how much the USA tries to argue the contrary.\n \n We do know that the case is being heard in the Revolutionary Court, which is known to handle special cases.  This could be good or bad, depending upon how you look at it.  This court has used it's discretion here to hold up the trial, and do a lot of special investigation on Jason's \"activities beyond the scope of journalism.\"  In the past, other foreign prisoners accused of spying have generally been released within a couple of months.  The court investigates and often makes their ruling without a trial. Often they find there is a lack of evidence and dismiss the charges.  They have also released prisoners without bail, kept the charges in place, but eventually drop it all and send the prisoner home.  But in this case, the imprisonment has dragged on, and is not a good sign for his eventual pardon.  However, this could also be because the court is holding this up pending the nuclear deal.\n \n I was thinking that the courts sudden deadline to appoint an attorney meant that Jason would be going to trial fairly soon.  However, after the WILDCARD Senate Republican's letter to Iran, I'm now thinking that they will sit on this, and hold it as another bargaining chip.  If they can play it during the next month before the nuclear talks deadline, they will, and I would think they would just release him without trial as a measure of good faith.  But if the talks go into a tailspin because of that letter from the Republican Senators, Jason won't be out by June 10th. He won't even have a trial date by then. However, the Iranians seem to be dismissing that letter out of hand.\n \n Right now, I'm slightly betting he will be held beyond the June 10th date. And this is based on the length of time he has been in there, and that it looks like they were prepared to take him to trial rather than dismiss the case for lack of evidence. This will be something to watch, and pretty much guess at, because the Iranians are letting very little out about this case.  Certainly, his release, or his trial, and perhaps his execution, will be swift, and a surprise.",

However, I am going to take a leap here and hope for the best.  Currency swaps take place when two entities swap an asset in two different currencies and two different interest rates.  Entity A can get a better interest rate in their home country and the same is true for entity B.  So they swap the assets and pay a lower interest rate on each end of the swap.  Presumably there is a net profit for both parties.\n \n Since the US Fed has begun to slow down the purchase of securities intended to stimulate the economy, hoping I suppose that the economy will get along just fine without the added input, this may have an impact on currency swaps with the People's Bank of China.  In light of this, I 'think' that China and the Fed are more likely to arrive at some sort of agreement regarding currency swaps by June 1, 2015.\n \n http://www.chinausfocus.com/finance-economy/china-should-actively-establish-a-currency-swap-pool/",

You can tell that nobody was inside there telling them: \"Bibi, this speech to Congress two weeks before your election may give you a sugar high for a day with Israeli voters, but it's in really poor taste for you to use America's Congress as a backdrop for your campaign. Many of Israel's friends will be uncomfortable, and the anti-Semites, who claim Israel controls Washington, will have a field day.\"\n \n Already, in reaction to this maneuver, 10 Senate Democrats - who had advocated putting more sanctions on Iran now - have instead parted company with the Republicans and granted the White House the two-month reprieve it was seeking to see if negotiations can still work. It was exactly the opposite of what Netanyahu wanted, and it shows how upset are many Democrats.\n \n But this isn't just churlish. For Israel's leader to so obviously throw his lot in with the Republicans against a Democratic president is reckless. Israel and its defenders are already under siege on college campuses across America, where many university boards are under pressure to divest from companies doing business with Israel. Making support for Israel more of a Republican cause is not at all in Israel's interest - or America's. Israel needs the support of more than just Congress or one party.\n ...\n ...if we do use force, success is hardly assured and the blowback unpredictable. That is why it is absolutely not in Israel's interest to give even the slightest appearance of nudging America toward such a military decision. Israel should stay a million miles away from that decision, making clear that it is entirely a U.S. matter. Because, if we do have to strike Iran, plenty of Americans will not be happy. And if it fails, or has costly consequences for us and our military, you can be sure a lot more Americans will not be happy - and some will ask, \"How did we get into this mess?\" One of the first things they'll dig out will be Netanyahu's speech to Congress.\n \n Why in the world would Israel risk putting itself in that situation?

        "All European states are eligible for membership. and these states need the approval of all the existing member states. This blocking does happen-- Greece is blocking Macedonia and Turkey is blocking Cyprus.\n \n The requirements for being a NATO member (generally speaking) are these: \n \n -Willingness to settle international, ethnic or external territorial disputes by peaceful means, commitment to the rule of law and human rights, and democratic control of armed forces\n \n -Ability to contribute to the organization's defense and missions\n     \n -Devotion of sufficient resources to armed forces to be able to meet the commitments of membership\n     \n -Security of sensitive information, and safeguards ensuring it\n     \n -Compatibility of domestic legislation with NATO cooperation\n \n The path goes thorough the Intensified Dialog stage and then to the Membership Action Plan stage. \n \n \n Ukraine: In 2005, Ukraine actually commenced an Intensified Dialog stage, which is a precondition to Membership Action Plan. But in 2010, Ukraine announced it was no longer pursuing NATO membership.  However, the Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk announced his intentions to resume the bid for NATO integration on 29 August 2014 through the Ukrainian parliament. Putin has said that Ukrainian NATO membership is a direct threat to Russia. \n \n Georgia: Georgia was told in June of 2014 that an MAP was unlikely.\n \n Montenegro: In June 2014, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen suggested that NATO would instead open \"intensified talks\" with the aim of inviting Montenegro to join the allience by the end of 2015\n \n \n Since Ukraine has already gone through some of the Intensified Dialog phase, and if the US wants to ram its thumb into Putin's eye, they may be able to fast track NATO membership. \n \n But the thrill of telling the Russians to pound sand would be short-lived, given that the Ukraine is a total basket case. Their army is crap, the economy is in the shitter and a large chunk of the country falls asleep dreaming of being annexed by Russia. NATO membership for Ukraine would almost certainly raise tensions in the region. Admitting them to the North Atlantic Alliance would be a bad idea. \n \n Which is why we are almost certain to consider it. Ideally we'll make noise about it to threaten Russia but won't go through with it. I'm setting my forecast at 30% to start with.",
        "There are obviously three countries involved in this which means a higher probability than for just a single country.  But even so I still think the overall probability is low.  Taking the countries one at a time:   I think Syria is the most likely to have a newly recognised state, as part of a negotiated peace deal.  But even this is unlikely.  I don't think either the regime or the opposition are calling for partition at this stage.  Iraq is the next most likely, with the option of the KRG becoming a separate state, but the current status quo of semi-autonomy doesn't seem under threat.  I can't see anyone recognising a state (presumably Kurdish) in Turkish territory, not least because of the diplomatic backlash it would spark from Turkey.  I don't think even Greece would be prepared to annoy them that much.  The creation and recognition of some supranational Kurdish entity is even less probable because it would involve two or more of the cases I have just dismissed as  improbable in isolation occurring together.  Overall, my view is that state recognition takes time and the international community is always cautious after the break up of Yugoslavia.

It has already respond to shelling of its territory by the syrian army at the begining of the war so there is some presedent.\n Israel may bomb the IS if it see it as a threat. The IS has been fighting in the golan heights, near the frontier of Israel, and sme spillover fighting could ingnite a response. The problem with this option is that Israel doesn't like to acknowledge their intervention in foregin countries unless it is too obious.\n Iran is a long time supporter of Assad, has provided him wiwth weapons and cash, and it is suspected with fighters. But again we encounter the problem of acknowledgement.\n Finaly the US. Obama vowed to destroy the IS and is already attacking them in Irak. The US is less likely to intervene in Syria, even after the Assad regime open itself to work with foregin countries agains the IS, because they don't want to appear alligned with the Assad regime, alienating the Sunnis even more.\n \n All that considered, even if each player has reasons to intervene and reasons to not do so, the large amount of enemies the IS has made makes them likely that someone will attack them (most likely throug airstrikes) in Syrian before the end of the year.\n Again, this is a first approach that could change with new developments and with new perspectives and information that i found.",

In this case, any near-term move by NATO to provide a MAP for additional membership would fall into the \"crazy\" category.  It would be deemed provocative and would be quite inconsistent with Western sanctions placed on Russia (to date) which have been relatively benign. \n \n While NATO has done some sabre rattling about setting up a rapid reaction force to blunt a Russian invasion, this type of positioning is consistent with the public show of strength by the parties but doesn't actually pose a perceive geo-political threat to Russia.  Moving toward new NATO MAP alliances does pose that threat.   \n \n While a MAP offer may still occur in the future, it would seem that it will take at least until May 2015 to simply de-escalate the current level of upheaval.

        "Found this on the East Asia Forum, maybe the idea is coming from these arguments. But I very much doubt there will be elections that quickly:\n\n\n\nAt the LDP National Convention last month, Sadakazu Tanigaki, the party's president, criticised Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda and his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) for their handling of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and labelled the proposed increase in Japan's consumption tax rate 'an empty cheat'. In order to return the LDP to power, Tanigaki has also vowed to pressure Noda to dissolve the lower house and call a snap election.\n\n\n\nThis uncompromising stance is largely in line with the obstructionist attitude adopted by the LDP when Noda's predecessor, Naoto Kan, was in power, and is likely to continue throughout Noda's term. Given that the government lacks an upper-house majority, the LDP can effectively block any of the government's bills, but there are several reasons why this strategy is unlikely to pay strong electoral dividends in the long run.\n\n\n\n",
        "Jordan will have parliamentary elections on December 2, but the outcome seems rigged:  http://thedailynewsegypt.com/2012/06/25/jordan-opposition-moves-boycott-elections/  Also: \"...protestors demanded the resignation of the Prime Minister, Fayez Tarawneh amid dismay over the price hikes which the government claims are needed in order to avoid an economic crisis caused by a large and increasing budget deficit.\"",

        "The uprising continues, but so fat it appears that he and his government will cling tooth and nail to power.  The Arab League has been pushing for a political solution, but the NYTimes and Economist seem pessimistic that they will accomplish anything.  That coupled to support by Russia and China (as Kristian notes) makes it unlikely that he will be removed.",
        "This seems unlikely in that most fighting in Ukraine is being carried out by pro-Russia rebels and not \"Russian military forces\". It is far less likely that Russian military will get (identifiably) involved in the conflict.",

        "From Wikipedia:\n \n Tit for tat is an English saying meaning \"equivalent retaliation\". It is also a highly effective strategy in game theory for the iterated prisoner's dilemma. The strategy was first introduced by Anatol Rapoport in Robert Axelrod's two tournaments,[1] held around 1980. Notably, it was (on both occasions) both the simplest strategy and the most successful in direct competition.[2]\n \n Looks similar to last years question.",
        "The Republicans, in control of both houses of congress, have decided to step on the president's toes in a way similar to how he has stepped on theirs on immigration. They are very unlikely to back out because they have strong ties to the pro-Israel lobby, they want to pressure the president, and now that this story has received a lot of air time in the media they will be emboldened by the relative lack of controversy as they encroach on the powers of the executive branch.",
        "The fact that the military in the affected countries is handling the epidemiological containment should almost make this a certainty.  USABRDL/Fort Detrick has been warning about this bad actor for over 25 years."
