        "The only recent official visit I could find a reference to was the visit of Putin to Tehran in 2007.  The base rate of official visits is thus very low - around 5-10%.  However, Iran has been more open to engaging with the rest of the world recently, so this is probably an underestimate.\n According to Iranian sources, Putin indicated this January that \"I hope to visit you in Tehran very soon.\" ([1]).  This source is not entirely credible, and there were previous reports of visits in July and September 2013 that have not taken place (see [2] for one of the better reports).  Still, I think Putin has a fair (20%) chance of visiting Iran in the period.\n There have also been not entirely credible reports that Xi Jinping will visit in 2015 (see [3]).  I will assign this a 15% probability.\n Of the G7 leaders, the most likely one to visit Tehran is probably Obama.  According to a recent article however, such a visit is a \"long shot\" ([4]).  I think this is about a 10% chance over the time period of the question.  I will also assign a 5% chance to another G7 leader visiting Tehran.\n Adding up my probabilities, and subtracting 10% to take into account visits by multiple leaders, I get a 40% estimate of a \"head of state\" (actually some of the leaders listed are only heads of government) visiting in the time period.\n The biggest wildcard here is the Iranian nuclear negotiations.

Afghan officials also say they believe Pakistan wields enough influence over the Taliban to force them to the negotiating table.\n \n Monday, a Taliban spokesman told VOA that the group rejects any negotiations with the Afghan government.\n \n Zabiullah Mujahid reiterated that talks with Kabul were not possible until foreign forces completely withdrew from Afghanistan. He also said that the government in Kabul was not sovereign.\n \n Regional analysts suggest there may be divisions within the Taliban ranks on whether to have a dialogue with Kabul.\n \n They say that if talks do not start soon, there may be a negative effect on Afghanistan's relations with Pakistan. Afghan officials insist that if the coming spring fighting season is as bloody as the previous one, that would suggest to them that Islamabad has not targeted the Afghan Taliban in its recent offensive against militants. \n \n Pakistan insists that it is targeting all militants in its efforts to uproot terrorism from the country and that it will not allow its soil to be used against any neighboring country. U.S. officials have acknowledged that Pakistan's recent military offensive in the North Waziristan region has disrupted the activities of the Afghan Taliban as well.\n \n This will be the first fighting season in which the Afghan National Army will face the militants without support from the U.S.-led international forces, which ended their combat mission in December.",

So the only reason for him to resign from office would be a) to bow down to the demand of protesters, or b) a military takeover. NS has specifically said that he will not cater to protesters demand though he said he will put up a judicial probe on last year's elections. \n \n So the only foreseeable reason why he steps down if he runs away or is arrested and military takes over. Military coups have happened in the past, the last one, in 1999, displaced NS himself. The 1999 coup happened in the aftermath of Kargil war, which was a disaster for Pakistan. Pakistan's military continues to be against any peace process with India and recent steps by NS to better relations with India may have antagonized the military. But the military has indicated that it is not supporting the protesters either. This is speculation: the protests may weaken NS's stance against military and that is all the military might want (and not displace NS and impose a direct rule). \n \n The situation remains volatile and needs to be monitored.

        "This is one of those low probability/high uncertainty IFPs where there's the potential to get badly burned.  Still I think a \"yes\" resolution is highly unlikely for several reasons.    First, forget about the explosive device.  The limiting factor in constructing IEDs is sourcing the explosive, not the fabrication of mechanical parts, and even then the triggering devices are electronic, not mechanical.  3D printing, aka additive manufacturing, makes machine parts, not electronics.  So I think we can concentrate on the firearms, which have been produced and do work well enough to kill somebody.  So, what are the potential advantages of such a pistol over any other pistol?  1) It can be obtained by individuals who are legally prohibited from obtaining firearms by legal means and in jurisdictions where firearms are unavailable whether legally or illegally.  2) Being made of plastic, such a pistol can theoretically evade detection by metal detectors.  But what are the disadvantages as compared with other pistols?  1) To produce such a weapon requires a high-quality 3D printer, the correct ABS plastic raw material and a moderate degree of technical expertice. 2) The fully plastic, undetectable version sans metal firing pin is probably less reliable than the partially metal version. 3) The ammunition is still made of metal--i.e. will be picked up by metal detectors--and must be obtained through usual licit or illicit pathways. 3) The pistol is a single shot weapon.   4) It is almost certainly horribly inaccurate. 5) Because it looks like a toy squirt gun, until its user actually fires it, it's useless for threatening people, and once he/she fires it, he/she must reload before firing it again, leaving time for anyone who they might want to threaten to, say, kick them in the balls or hit them over the head with a chair.  I reckon that the world over, the kind of people who have it in them to shoot and kill their fellow men would have an easier time obtaining standard pistols than one of these printed items.  I reckon that also they'd be rightfully wary of going into a fight with a pistol whose first shot stands a fair chance of missing its target and that doesn't give you a second shot.  This is the kind of weapon that's really only good for executing a helpless victim at point-blank range, and if that's the situation a knife or a piece of baling wire would serve the assasin just as well and with a lot less fuss.

        "The threat of ISIS is growing in the region, and so far only Kurdish militia and military members have been able to hold off advances. Given the poor performance of Iraqi regular military forces, support from outside countries is more likely to go towards the Kurds.\n \n Another factor in this is that Turkey has been negotiating with various Kurdish groups to enable stability in that region. Turkey also provided some assistance for the Kurds to export Kurdish oil out of the region. While the main Bagdad government still opposes an independent Kurdish state, this may prove to be an opportune time for a referendum, as long as some economic cooperation can remain in the future.\n \n The other wildcard factor is US support for the Kurds, and the growing presence of US military resources in the region to combat ISIS. The US will be more likely to support an organized Kurdish Republic, than a disorderly Iraqi government. US support, alongside Turkey, will be a factor in a Kurdish referendum.\n \n The uncertainty on the deadline is due to the evolving nature of the conflict with ISIS.

The officials told WND that Moscow is considering the proposal but that there was no immediate decision from Russia.  The officials said the proposal was likely a response to Iranian reports of US vessels in the Persian Gulf.  The WND report said there have been reports that the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman has deliberately spent time outside the Persian Gulf as a gesture to Iran while the West attempts to implement its interim nuclear agreement with Tehran.  However, the Iranians believe the US made a decision to send warships toward the Emirates and Bahrain.  Last week, senior naval commander Adm. Afshin Rezayee Haddad said that his country sent a destroyer and helicopter-carrying supply ship to the Atlantic. He said the ships will sail close to the US maritime borders.  While Russia may not have responded to the Iranian offer of a joint naval exercise, Tehran&apos;s ambassador to Moscow, Mehdi Sanayee, told reporters yesterday the two countries are looking for ways to expand ties.  \"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have agreed on the expansion of ties between Tehran and Moscow,\" Sanayee said.

        "Most analysts identify the parallels between today's oil surplus and that of the 1980s and conclude that Saudi Arabia (and its Gulf allies) will defend OPEC's market share (i.e, not cut output) rather than attempt to support falling oil prices with a cut in output -- at least in the short term. Analysts point out that cutting OPEC oil output may not halt the slide in prices because non-OPEC suppliers can readily compensate for any reduced supply. \n \n Among OPEC members, opposition to cuts appears to carry far more weight than support for cuts. Oil ministers in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE openly oppose such cuts, making them \"highly unlikely\" (online.wsj.com/articles/gulf-states-to-oppose-any-cut-to-opec-ceiling-at-next-meeting-1413458857). Libya is the only African OPEC member to call for cuts; Algeria has stated it is unconcerned with the price slide, while Nigeria and Angola have not officially stated views. Venezuela has called for an emergency meeting before the 11/27 scheduled meeting, but Iran -- which previously called for a cut -- has changed position (finance.yahoo.com/news/shift-opec-price-hawk-iran-151406100.html). Notably, OPEC's oil demand growth projections have remained unchanged, winter is approaching, and the price slide gives OPEC an opportunity to test the limits of North American producers.\n \n Fifteen percent represents the wildcard factor: the possibility of an unknown event (weather, armed conflict, political negotiation/compromise, epidemic, etc.) that could impact oil production, distribution and/or prices during this IFP time frame.",

The co-ruling Pasok party would get 5.1 percent.\n \n About 15 percent of those polled said they were undecided.\n \n  \n A survey by the same pollster in October had shown Syriza leading with 6.5 percentage points over New Democracy.\n \n The ruling coalition last week brought a key presidential vote forward by two months, leaving a final bailout review and plans for a negotiated exit from its EU/IMF bailout program up in the air, while it seeks parliamentary backing.\n \n To survive the vote, the government needs the backing of 180 lawmakers. Failure to get its nominee for the largely ceremonial post elected by the final round of voting on Dec. 29 would trigger a snap parliamentary election.\n \n About 64 percent of those polled by GPO last week approved of the government's decision to bring the presidential vote forward. More than half of the respondents said they wanted the current parliament to elect a president, while 59 percent said the risk of a euro zone exit had not been removed.\n \n Tsipras ranked first in popularity among political leaders, but Samaras was more suitable for prime minister, the poll showed.\n \n The GPO poll was the latest in a series of surveys that showed the gap between Syriza and New Democracy narrowing after the government brought the presidential vote forward.\n \n A separate survey by MRB for Mega TV, which was conducted Dec. 10-13, showed Syriza leading with 3.2 percentage points.\n \n An Alco poll published on Sunday showed Syriza's lead narrowing to 3.6 percentage points, from 4.8 percent earlier this month.\n \n ****",

Libya is currently completely broken until warring factions, including a provisional parliament, the old elected government assembly, a radical group who call themselves Libya Dawn, and various other Islamic groups. There are simply too many factions to form any kind of a functioning government in six months. The NY times reported on the 18th that the various militant groups have agreed to a ceasefire in order to hold peace talks. However, as the same article admits, the truce was poorly worded and \"none of the antagonists may feel constrained by the cease-fire agreements\". ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/world/middleeast/libya-militias-agree-to-halt-in-fighting-with-caveats.html?_r=0 )\n \n The best comparison class for this situation that I could find is Tunisia, Libya's northern African neighbor country, which underwent a violent revolt in 2011. A unity government was formed by Tunisian PM Mohammed Ghannouchi after the president, Ben Ali, was removed from office due to human rights abuses, restrictions of media rights, terrible unemployment, etc. Violent protests against the police resulted in dozens of deaths. In this situation, a unity government worked because there was still somewhat of an infrastructure in place (the PM and various cabinet members) to maintain order and to QUICKLY react to the president being ousted before total chaos took over. Compare this with Libya, where the death of former leader Muammar Gaddafi has led to many, many warring factions and radical groups essentially running rampant over the country. There is simply no foundation that could support a unity government right now. \n BBC article that discussed the Tunisia situation:\n http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12209621\n \n Just today, reported \"fresh violence\" caused the parliament (currently at war with the elected assembly) to suspend the UN-backed peace talks.

        "I agree with all of Ron's reasoning in relation to Syria conducting a significant incursion into Israeli territory.  However, looking at the definition under \"More Info\" of what constitutes an \"attack\" for this question, it reads: \"An attack is defined as any unwelcomed firing into territory or territorial waterways by a manned or unmanned foreign military aircraft, surface-to-surface artillery, gun, or rocket/missile firing ordnance or carrying explosives or bullets, and the attack must be officially acknowledged by the government of at least one of the attacking states. An attack against an (e.g. Country X's) embassy abroad does not constitute an attack against Country X. Also outside the scope of \"attack\" are alleged actions attributed to covert intelligence services or representatives thereof, unless those actions are expressly acknowledged by the government of the attacking state(s). For the purposes of the questions, an attack by Syria means an attack by (at least some subset of) official Syrian governmental forces.\"  This definition could include a minor border skirmish, a single shell being fired over the border, an \"accidental\" firing under heightened tensions or something similarly minor.  I think if the if a US led force does attack Syria, tension around the Golan Heights will rise and this type of event becomes significantly more likely.  Syria, may also look incrementally to escalate the crisis by trying to provoke Israel by instigating some minor border clash.  All of this leads to rate the probability of a yes as higher.",

        "All of the sources I've seen seem to agree that China will almost certainly be establishing a peak year, so the uncertainty in this question surrounds the timetable.\n \n As I read the announcement, the peak is expected to be announced as part of the next (thirteenth) five-year guideline [5], the drafting of which is just getting under way.[1]  Information on the timetable for the drafting of the plan is maddeningly hard to come by, but judging from the chronology of the 12th guideline [2] we should expect the plan to be announced following the plenary session of the Central Committee in the year prior to the year it is supposed to take effect (that's 2015 meeting/2016 effective in this case) and adopted by the National People's Congress the following spring.  As usual, GJP and its sponsor are frustratingly vague about whether the announcement from the Central Committee would count as an \"official announcement,\" since technically the plan isn't a done deal until adoption by the NPC.  However, since the NPC is widely viewed as a rubber-stamp for the Central Committee, I think the Central Committee announcement would count.\n \n The Central Committee usually holds its plenary sessions in the fall [3,4], so that would suggest that there is not much chance of an official announcement before the June cutoff.  HOWEVER, in 2013 there was an additional plenary session in February, and if they had a similar extra session in 2015, they might just be able to make an announcement then.  That said, early 2015 would be a very compressed timeline for producing the proposal for the thirteenth guideline.\n \n In light of all that, I'm going with a 10% chance of a spring plenary announcement, and another 5% chance of an announcement outside of the five-year guideline framework, for a total of 15%.\n \n \n [1] http://chinawatch.washingtonpost.com/2013/08/preparation-starts-on-13th-five-year-plan.php\n [2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China#Twelfth_Guideline_.282011.E2.80.932015.29\n [3] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China#Chronology\n [4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th_Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China#Chronology\n [5] http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/03/china-climatechange-idUKL3N0OK1VH20140603",

The incubation period (8-10 days, up to 21 days) is long enough to travel to another country without symptoms and then manifest Ebola later.  \n \n In addition to the likelihood that Ebola makes it to an EU member state through \"chance,\" I am forecasting high on this question because the disparity in health care between West Africa and an EU member state like the UK is so high that it creates the incentive to engage in Trojan Horse-like behavior.  \n \n If a person with enough means to purchase air travel knows they have been exposed to Ebola in West Africa, their best shot at survival is to book a flight asap to a country that will be able to provide the supportive care that brings the 90% fatality rate down to 50-60%.  This reality was highlighted recently when medical personnel in Liberia were transported to the US to receive care that resulted in their survival.  For these reasons, I am forecasting high--any difference between my forecast and 100% is due to my uncertainty regarding timing (i.e. before the close of this question at the end of May, 2015) rather than the certainty of the event ever happening.",

        "I don't know if anyone else subscribes to Financial Times so I am copying the article I read to here: (very interesting!)\n \n For critics of the Kremlin, there's a delicious irony in this tale\n \n A general view of the headquarters of Russian gas giant Gazprom during the company's Annual General Meeting of shareholders in Moscow in this June 29, 2012 file photo. As bankers, traders and investors gathered at Gazprom's London offices for its annual champagne reception, the message from the world's most powerful gas trader was clear: the Russians don't want another gas war with Ukraine. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/Files (RUSSIA - Tags: BUSINESS ENERGY POLITICS)(C)Reuters\n \n In November 2005, a pipeline called Blue Stream was inaugurated to bring Russian gas across the Black Sea to Turkey. It was, said President Vladimir Putin, who attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony, \"just the start\".\n \n Mr Putin envisaged another Black Sea pipeline from Russia: a longer and more ambitious one, making landfall in Bulgaria and providing a handy southern conduit for Russian gas to the Balkans and eastern Europe - bypassing troublesome Ukraine. South Stream was born.\n \n With Kremlin backing, this \u00e2\u0082\u00ac15bn project always looked like a dead cert. But its future is looking increasingly murky. South Stream has become one of the biggest casualties of the east-west stand-off over Ukraine. There is now potential for huge delays. Sceptics wonder whether it will happen at all.\n \n In many ways, the project has become a symbol of the hardening of attitudes between Moscow and Brussels since the start of the Ukraine crisis. A cautious but heartfelt rapprochement has been replaced by tit-for-tat sanctions, asset freezes and visa bans. Russian-European co-operation on energy is now a pipe dream.\n \n For critics of the Kremlin, there's a delicious irony in this tale. Moscow has long been accused by the west of using its energy exports as a political weapon. With one of its pet projects now ensnared in EU bureaucracy, it's finally getting a taste of its own medicine.\n \n South Stream once seemed to have impeccable logic. After pricing disputes with Kiev in 2006 and 2009 led to cuts in supply to its European customers, Gazprom had been desperate to reduce its dependence on the Ukrainian gas transit system. South Stream bypassed Ukraine entirely. But even before Russia annexed Crimea in March, many in Brussels were beginning to worry that it would cement Gazprom's domination of the European gas market. Others feared it would leave Ukraine dangerously exposed: once South Stream was built, Gazprom could switch off supplies to its western neighbour without inconveniencing its other European customers.\n \n Those Brussels worries have now hardened into outright opposition. The European Commission is insisting that other gas suppliers be given access to South Stream. It says the idea of Gazprom both providing the gas and owning the pipeline through which it flows contravenes the EU's \"third energy package\" - and, these days, Brussels is in no mood to grant Gazprom an exemption.\n \n Attempts to reach a solution have failed. The commission recently suspended talks aimed at bringing South Stream into line with EU laws. It has forced Bulgaria to freeze construction work on its section of the pipeline and is also investigating whether Sofia breached EU competition rules in the way it awarded South Stream-related contracts. One beneficiary, Stroytransgaz, had to pull out after its owner Gennady Timchenko was hit by western sanctions.\n \n Gazprom insists the project remains on track. It has used its commercial muscle to exploit divisions between regulators and energy groups eager to maintain close ties with Russia - signing deals with Allseas Group and Saipem to build the offshore parts of the pipeline, and with Austria's OMV to build a spur from the Hungarian border to a gas hub near Vienna.\n \n But delays seem inevitable. Brussels-watchers say negotiations over a third-party waiver - allowing Gazprom to operate the pipeline exclusively - could take years, despite heavy lobbying by companies with stakes in the project, such as Eni. And Gazprom is already being investigated by the commission over alleged anti-competitive practices.\n \n Meanwhile, there are big doubts about South Stream's commercial logic. The project was always driven more by politics than business and, with gas demand still slack in Europe - partly due to the huge surge in renewables and cheap coal from the US - Gazprom may not even need the pipeline. Ilya Zaslavskiy, of think-tank Chatham House, says the company already has 100bn cubic metres per annum of spare export capacity, which could rise to at least 160bcma if South Stream is built. It would, he says, be a \"commercial disaster for the Russian budget\".\n \n If Brussels blocks the pipeline, it may therefore do Gazprom a favour. The company would be forced to behave in a more commercial way, ditching its plans for an expensive boondoggle where an alternative - the Ukrainian gas transit system - exists, and diverting the funds to more pressing projects such as domestic infrastructure and an export pipeline to China. It may not be such a bad thing for Russia if Mr Putin's pet pipeline never happens at all. \n                              ###\n \n Sorry for the long read, I hope you found it as interesting as I did....I think this sums up the issue pretty well, and I believe the answer is that the pipeline is not a political animal, but a business venture and as such it is a failure.  Soooo, someone needs to tell the Emperor he is butt naked!  M.",

Among the contributions, \"the peaking year might be included,\"\n \n But I can find no relevant news since then.  There is a August 13 \"science\" discussion at http://www.nature.com/news/china-should-aim-for-a-total-cap-on-emissions-1.15705 which says\n \n First, China needs to obtain better data. Researchers must work out when Chinese emissions are likely to peak, assuming that the economy continues to grow as expected. This will provide a reliable baseline for any reduction target. It will require international scientific cooperation, because modelling for China must be informed by research results about the trajectory of emissions patterns in the EU, United States and other developed regions.  The peaking year is a complex issue and Chinese scientists and scholars differ greatly in their opinions of it.\n \n In other words, it is not easy to do at the technical level.  \n   \n (2) But in essence this issue is entirely political.  On the one hand China does not want to be tied down even to a weak non-binding target like this, without something similar from the US.  At the other extreme China could conceivably do a grand gesture in the JFK \"we will land a man on the moon within the decade\" style.  On this and many other matters,  China has to choose between engaging constructively with the international community, or following a realpolitik view of self-interest.  \n \n From a combination of general pessimism re (2) and the several \"maybes\" in (1)  I will start with a forecast of 25%.",
        "I agree with shalter1.  Looking at the correlates of war database, significant lethal confrontations of this kind are fairly rare.  The only ones I can find involving Iran or Pakistan in the last 10 years are the 2005 and 2010 Iranian quasi-invasions of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This would correspond to a base rate of 4% or so for any confrontation involving either country.  The recent tensions (in particular, the shelling of a Pakistani town by Iran ([1])) would seem to indicate a higher number.  However, Iran and Pakistan have generally positive relations, and reconciliation efforts have been made.\n As well, the restrictions placed on this question are considerable.  15 fatalities is a lot for a clash in this region.  Even if the situation escalates, this would be hard to achieve.

In addition, Putin knows that there would be significant casualties from an outright invasion, as well as asymmetric warfare a la Gaza.\n \n However, the Ukranians have had a surprising amount of success counteracting these proxies in Lugansk and Donetsk, which will force Putin to make a choice: intervene more directly (and the aid convoy is an example of this) or concede that that Ukrainians have won and withdraw. The latter course would be too humiliating and might cast doubt on his continued leadership of Russia, so I expect some kind of escalation.\n \n The aid convoy appears to be an attempt to escalate without resorting to an open invasion, as does alleged artillery shelling from Russia. (I would also note that some of the paramilitaries are likely Russian regular military who have removed their insignia.)\n \n There is also a point where Putin will reason that the sanctions have been imposed, public opinion in Germany has turned against him, and he has little to lose by going for broke.

The military had to act to prevent a sharia law dominated society.  This does not mean that the military will preclude political parties rooted in religion.  To do so would condemn the country to internal violence for decades as the Mulsim Brotherhood will not go away.  I believe instead the focus will (should) be on drafting a constitution which ensures separation of powers so that should a religious based political party come to power, they will not be able to take over all of the government and democratic processes can be sustained.  In other words the constitution must limit the power.  The F-16s are intended for air combat and their use against civilians demonstrators is inconsequential.

After a warmer August, that difference is down to 2,127 square kilometers greater sea ice on 21 August 2014 than 21 August 2013. That means that, from 8 August to the 21 August, we lost 175,566 more square kilometers of ice this year than last year. \n \n The trend is rapidly heading toward a lower sea ice perigee this year than last year. Since 21 August 2014, the average daily sea ice loss is 13,505 square kilometers greater than the same time last year.

This is not a bad time to get them out.  Third, Germany is smart and knows that the real problems are Podemos in Spain and just about everyone in Italy and maybe even a few people (or more) in France.

On 11 February, the euro area finance ministers will meet to discuss Greece (Eurogroup) followed by the meeting of Heads of State on 12 February.\n \n 2- We would expect some clear signals of what are the intentions of the Greek government and the EU following those meetings.

        "Religion, the economy, Islamist, issues with Israel, influx of Syrian refugees, are all factors in domestic political problems.\n \n In Jordan, support for political Islam has held relatively steady. In 2006, 52 percent favored political Islam compared to 47 percent in 2012.\n \n Jordan's small size, lackluster economy, divided population, controlled political system, weak resource base, geographic location, and cooperation with the West are inherent vulnerabilities that U.S. policy makers seek to mitigate. The kingdom fears a terrorist backlash stemming from its participation in coalition air strikes against the IS. The government also is concerned over its ability to materially provide for over 618,000 United Nations-registered Syrian refugees currently\n residing in Jordan (there may be hundreds of thousands of more who are unregistered). Finally, Jordanian leaders also believe that should recent clashes over Jerusalem continue, such violence could spread to the kingdom and radicalize Jordanians of Palestinian origin either against their own government or against Israel. This past October, Jordan and Israel celebrated the 20-year anniversary of their bilateral peace agreement amidst an overall tense diplomatic atmosphere over the status of holy sites in Jerusalem.\n \n Economy - With few natural resources and a small industrial base, Jordan has an economy which is heavily dependent on external aid from abroad, tourism, expatriate worker remittances,and the service sector. Among the long-standing problems Jordan faces are poverty (15%-30%), corruption, slow economic growth, and high levels of unemployment, nominally around 13% but thought by many analysts to be in the 25%-30% range. Youth unemployment is nearly 30%. Corruption is particularly pronounced in Jordan. Use of intermediaries, referred to in Arabic as \"Wasta\" (connections), is widespread, and many young Jordanians have grown frustrated by the lack of\n social and economic mobility that corruption engenders.23 Each year, thousands of Jordanians go abroad in search of better jobs and opportunities. Like many poor countries, Jordan suffers from a \"brain drain\" of its most talented workers, and the government has struggled to develop incentives to keep its well-educated, highly skilled workers close to home. The government is by far the largest employer, with between one-third and two-thirds of all workers on the state's payroll. \n \n http://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33546.pdf",

In order to determine what may happen, absent the many wild cards' in this situation--no one saw MH17 getting shot down during this--let's review what we believe we know about Mr. Putin and Russia to this point with Ukraine. A quick summary: \n \n --Russia acts in Ukraine after the uprising (Feb. 2014) a day after the White House explicitly states that Russia should stay out of the situation.\n --White House and EU condemn Russia's plan to annex Crimea, Russia does it anyway.\n --Putin claims that Russian troops are not involved, yet there are Russian speaking troops wearing unmarked uniforms, that are clearly trained military, with heavy military equipment that magically appeared. \n --Putin said he reserved the right to defend Russian speaking minorities in a civil war.\n --The West, the U.S. and EU initiate light sanctions on Russia. Nothing changes in Ukraine with Russia.\n --Putin has said that, \"The breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century.\"\n --New and tougher sanctions from the EU and US after MH17, yet there is no reverse of support from Russia of rebels.\n --US satellite images appear to show rockets being fired from the Russian side of the border (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/27/satellite-images-us-show-russian-rocket-fire-into-ukraine)\n --Putin's approval numbers in Russia are at all time highs since the crisis, which can further embolden Putin in Ukraine.\n --\"Humanitarian aid\" trucks sent in from Russia, despite international statements that it would be a violation of international law and a provocation if it happened. The West does nothing in response.\n --Must remember what happened in Georgia in 2006 by Russia.\n \n Based on what has happened so far I believe it shows that 1). Putin cannot be trusted 2). Russia is not being deterred by the sanctions, and has even been emboldened by weak response 3). Russia is operating under a policy of semi \"plausible deniability\" for actions, i.e. unidentified troops, \"humanitarian aid\" 4). Putin wants to rebuild Russia's influence to what it was like under the Soviet Union. 5.) It appears Russia is looking to bait Ukraine into a military confrontation that will result in Russia being able to use open military force. 6.) The situation appears to be continuing to deteriorate.\n \n In regards to the latest \"humanitarian aid\" truck invasion into Ukraine, while Ukraine leaders classify it as a \"direct invasion\" they have \"ruled out the use of force against the convoy....Western leaders fear the convoy could serve as a pretext for direct Russian intervention in the conflict between government forces and pro-Russia rebels....\"(http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/russian-convoy-crosses-border-ukraine-without-permission) A senior British security official states that, \"the Kremlin is well down the route of plotting a military invasion. Such a move was going to be \"low-level\" they said, but was likely to accompany the aid convoy as some kind of peacekeeping initiative....NATO also said the aid initiative had coincided with a big ramp-up of Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine since mid-August. \"Russian artillery support - both cross-border and from within Ukraine - is being employed against the Ukrainian armed forces,\" said spokesperson Oana Lungescu. \"Since mid-August we have multiple reports of the direct involvement of Russian forces including airborne, air defence and special operations forces in Eastern Ukraine.\" (http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4426dc70-29de-11e4-914f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3BFlKw3v8)\n \n I believe that absent help from Russia, the rebel fighters will be unable to hold out for another month against a Ukrainian offensive, prompting the question of what Russia will do? A direct confrontation between Ukrainian and Russian military forces is the next logical step to happen, yet I'm unsure whether Russia would go so far, as this would probably prompt a NATO response of peacekeepers being sent in, which would not be in Russia's interest--the status quo of keeping Ukraine destabilized with rebels is Russia's interest. Currently it seems Ukraine has adopted the policy of being passive towards Russian aggression, in order to avoid a military confrontation and not give Putin the chance to allege provocation. \n \n In conclusion, I feel that absent a wild card of a Ukrainian or Russian soldier just cutting lose from policy--which in high tension situations could happen--there will not be a direct open and lethal confrontation involving Russia and Ukrainian national forces before Oct. 1st. \n \n \n \n ",

        "From wtonewsstand.com:\n \"Posted: November 17, 2014 This week promises to be a busy one for U.S. trade policy. Things kicked off with an effort by United States and European leaders to jump-start the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations by giving new political impetus to the talks, which have slowed in part due to the transition to a new European Commission. In a joint statement issued on Nov. 16 after their meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Australia, President Obama and EU leaders reaffirmed their commitment to \"comprehensive and ambitious negotiations, in a spirit of mutual benefit,\" leading to a high-standard TTIP agreement. That message could be aimed at responding to calls by some in the EU, such as European Parliament International Trade (INTA) Committee Chairman Bernd Lange, for both sides to scale back the scope of the negotiations. Notably, the joint statement did not call for the negotiations to be concluded in 2015, as EU heads-of-government have collectively called for, but merely directed negotiators \"to make all possible progress over the coming year.\" \n \n In sum, agreement by June is unlikely.  If the ISDS issue is resolved in advance, an interim announcement to that effect is also unlikely. The agreement is more likely to be presented as a complete package to limit parties' ability to cherry pick.  Even if announced, I don't believe ISDS isn't the only issue holding up the process, so I'm not predicting as wide a spread as my teammates at this point.  (I'm traveling with only a tablet, so better research will need to wait until early next week.)\n \n \n ",

        "Moderate forecast.\n \n Most important 1.\n \n The best I have found:\n \n When Will China Set up an ADIZ in the South China Sea?\n \n http://cogitasia.com/when-will-china-set-up-an-adiz-in-the-south-china-sea/\n \n \n 1. When China has increased military capabilities in the region\n \n China currently lacks the capabilities to adequately monitor and enforce such a zone in the South China Sea. The PLA Air Force's (PLAAF) limited aerial refueling capabilities constrain its ability to project airpower. While the PLAAF does have radar capabilities, including passive electronically-scanned array radars for fighters and an over the horizon radar system, it cannot cover the entire South China Sea. The PLA Navy's aircraft carrier Liaoning, which recently conducted an exercise there, could help monitor the airspace, but it will not be fully operational for a few years.\n \n China is increasing its capabilities and presence within its claimed nine-dashed line, however. The South Sea Fleet conducted a combat drill last October and in January three Chinese ships patrolled James Shoal, an island 50 miles from Malaysia that marks the southernmost part of China's territorial claim. Beijing plans to base a 5,000 ton civilian patrol ship in Sansha City, on the Paracel Islands, from which it will \"establish a regular patrol system\" to safeguard the nation's maritime interest. Once China develops sufficient capabilities to effectively monitor the sea and airspace in the region, the establishment of an ADIZ in the South China Sea is more likely.\n \n 2. When China has convinced its neighbors of its non-aggressive intentions\n \n 3. When China feels provoked by neighbors\n \n \n At present China lacks sufficient military capabilities to enforce such a zone, has yet to successfully persuade its neighbors of China's benign intentions, and does not see regional nations as posing an imminent threat to Chinese interests. Therefore, Beijing is unlikely to establish an ADIZ for the time being. It is only a matter of time, however, before China attains the necessary military capabilities to maintain an ADIZ in the South China Sea. Once China has that military capacity, either of the other two factors above could trigger a new ADIZ. If China is both strong enough and can either successfully convince its neighbors in the South China Sea of its benign intentions, or if Beijing feels sufficiently threatened by those same neighbors, China will then be highly likely to set up an ADIZ in the area.\n ",

        "Given all the reasons I cite below, I believe it extremely unlikely NATO will offer a MAP to any new country before late 2015.  There is little to gain, and much at risk, if NATO takes any sudden moves.\n \n Background.  NATO announced earlier this year that it would not offer any new countries membership in 2014.  But NATO is in various stages of considering five countries as candidates:  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Ukraine.  The first four were designated as \"aspirant countries\" at the North Atlantic Council meeting in December 2011.  However, each country faces obstacles to admission.  One problem for some is Russian opposition, which is deeply hostile to NATO advancing into former Soviet republics.  There are other problems as well (note: the following list is not exhaustive).\n  \n - Bosnia-Herzegovina has been unable to pass a key condition set by the alliance: transfer of 63 defense facilities from local authorities to the central government.\n - Georgia has not been offered a MAP out of fear of Russian retaliation.  Georgia fought a brief war with Russia in 2008, during which Georgia's rebel regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia broke away.  NATO could have been obliged to intervene in the advent of another war.  However, NATO indicated in early September 2014 that it would give Georgia 'enhanced status' as a NATO partner.\n - NATO's invitation to Macedonia was blocked by Greece in 2008.  Greece objects to the use of the name by the Republic of Macedonia because the adjacent Greek province is also called Macedonia.  NATO nations agreed that the country would receive an invitation upon resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute. \n - Montenegro was granted a MAP in 2009.  According to one source, the former Yugoslav republic of Montenegro is widely considered the candidate closest to achieving membership.  Citing the need for further reforms, Secretary-General Rasmussen said NATO would open \"intensified and focused talks, and we will assess at the latest by the end of 2015 whether to invite Montenegro to join the alliance\".\n - Ukraine's prime minister said in late August 2014 that he would ask parliament to put the country on a path towards NATO membership.  However, it is unclear if Ukrainian citizens will support such action, or what NATO's response will be to such a request.  Red-hot Russian rage to a Ukrainian application for admission is a given.\n \n Sources:\n \n \"Ukrainians Still Don't Want To Join NATO,\" Forbes, , 9/23/2014 @ 8:24AM (http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2014/09/23/ukrainians-still-dont-want-to-join-nato/)\n \n \"Hagel: U.S. Backs Georgia's New NATO Standing, Boosts Defense Support,\"\n DoD News, By Cheryl Pellerin, Sept. 7, 2014 (http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=123105)\n \n \"NATO Too Wary of Russian Threats to Let Ukraine Join,\" Time, Simon Shuster, Sept. 4, 2014 (http://time.com/3271057/nato-ukraine-membership/)\n \n \"Ukraine to seek Nato membership, says PM Yatsenyuk,\" BBC, 29 August 2014 Last updated at 06:39 ET (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28978699)\n \n \"NATO rules out admitting new members anytime soon,\" Fox News, Associated Press, Published July 05, 2014 (http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/07/05/nato-rules-out-admitting-new-members-anytime-soon/)\n \n \"NATO will not offer Georgia membership step, avoiding Russia clash,\" Reuters, By Adrian Croft, Wed Jun 25, 2014 8:35am EDT (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/25/us-nato-enlargement-idUSKBN0F00IJ20140625)\n \n \"Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to NATO,\" Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_to_NATO)\n \n Accession of Macedonia to NATO,\" Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Macedonia_to_NATO#cite_note-veto-1)\n \n \"Macedonia naming dispute,\" Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute)\n \n \"Accession of Montenegro to NATO,\" Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Montenegro_to_NATO)\n \n \"Enlargement of NATO,\" Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_NATO)",

But Al-Abadi's government has so far been reluctant to table a bill for debate in the Iraqi parliament, or to allocate a budget and work out logistics, apparently because of sharp disagreements inside the coalition government.\n \n Iraqi Shia leaders, meanwhile, have warned that if the Sunni force was established outside the Baghdad government's control, any chances for peace would be derailed. They have demanded the Shia-led government's strict supervision over the new force and the integration of their own militias into the National Guard.\n \n The Kurds, who maintain their own Peshmerga forces, are also openly hostile to any plan to allow Arab troops to share the policing of provinces under their control, especially the oil-rich Kirkuk province and other disputed areas captured amidst the IS-triggered chaos. \n \n For the Guard project to be a success, Washington will need to enlist the support of various Sunni groups.

It may be an effort to keep US exporters in check,  \"Saudi Arabia is quietly telling the oil market it would be comfortable with much lower oil prices for an extended period, a sharp shift in policy that may be aimed at slowing the expansion of rival producers including those in the U.S. shale patch.\"\n \n In that same article, \"Ali al-Omair, oil minister of Saudi Arabia's core Gulf ally Kuwait, appeared to be the first to articulate the emerging view of OPEC's most influential member, saying output cuts would do little to prop-up prices in the face of rising production from Russia and the United States.\"\n \n Historically, Saudi Arabia has shouldered the burden of production cuts. It does not appear willing to do so now. Gulf Business reports(3) that Saudi Arabia actually \"raised its oil production in September by 100,000 barrels per day\" in an apparent attempt to maintain market share.\n \n The decision not to hold an emergency OPEC meeting before November 27th to discuss production, suggests a lack of urgency inside Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\n \n OPEC last cut its production target during the depths of the 2008 recession.

That said - would expect France to have mature customs and quarantine procedures to identify folks & animals travelling from high-risk areas.\n \n Animal migration patterns is another wildcard; while primary carrier ([West African] fruit bats) are not seen as migrating that far from West Africa; there could be other migratory species.\n \n Given relatively short incubation phase and that humans are not contagious until symptoms emerge; I would think it would be fairly low risk that human-to-human contamination would occur.

The Kurds would dearly love to have their own country and they probably deserve to have it, since they're the largest ethnic group in the world not to have a homeland.  Whether or not a referendum would actually happen depends on a number of political pressures, largely from the United States.

As a consequence, the Kurds are hated by the Turks, the Afghanis, the Syrians, the Iraqis, and the Iranians, all of whom would love nothing better than to see them exterminated.  The Turks have tried for decades to beat up on them, as have the Iranians and the Syrians.  The only break they've ever gotten was from the United States in the person of George Herbert Walker bush, when he instituted the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq.  That no-fly zone gave them a chance to form their own quasi-independent federation without fear of reprisals from Sadaam Hussein.\n \n Independence would give the United States a strong ally in the region, probably one of the best possible, but it would anger the Turks, a NATO ally and the Iranians, who are causing the US enough trouble already.",

        "Assess small possibility of 'attack' occurring before end of the year due to several past instances of limited fire from Syrian forces into Israeli territory.  Due to the wide nature of the 'yes' realization, i.e. \"An attack is defined as any unwelcomed firing into territory or territorial waterways by a manned or unmanned foreign military aircraft, surface-to-surface artillery, gun, or rocket/missile firing ordnance or carrying explosives or bullets, and the attack must be officially acknowledged by the government of at least one of the attacking states\" even limited firing could be interpreted as an attack.  Previous instances include:  http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/08/18/Israel-responds-to-errant-Syrian-shelling/UPI-56011376827452/ http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57583024/syrian-mortar-shell-lands-in-golan-heights-israel/ http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/07/14/Shell-from-Syria-hits-Israeli-occupied-Golan.html  Also note that an official Syrian attack is highly unlikely due to al-Assad's current relative position of strength vis a vis FSA forces.  As noted in the WSJ article: \"The prevailing assessment of many Israeli security and regional experts is that the Syrian regime, despite veiled threats of an attack on Israel, is unlikely to attack the Jewish state in order to avoid having to fight on another front and risk losing to the rebels.\"  Engagement of conventional forces by Israel would result in heavy losses for Syria, and tie up resources needed for continued operations against FSA forces.  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323906804579039084159645284.html  In the result of a multinational strike against Syria, Israel may be the subject of small-scale retalitory strikes from Syria, which is why I assign a 10% probability (along with the aforementioned unintentional attack possibility).",
        "The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Arctic Sea Ice Monitor has tons of historical measurements on its website (http://www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/seaice/extent/plot_v2.csv) for easy comparison. \n  I have crunched some numbers for the previous 3 years and discovered the following trend for the 2 summer months leading to September 15. They are as follows:\n 7/15-9/15/2011-- less 2904539 or 46847/day\n 7/15-9/15/2012-- less 4416308 or 71230/day\n 7/15-9/15/2013-- less 2907784 or 46899/day\n \n 2012 was a much faster melt than 2011 or 2013. I looked at changes from earlier in the year to see which past year 2014 most resembled. I wondered if the early months of this year looked more like 2012 or more like 2011/2013?\n 4/15-6/15/2011-- less 3460869 or 56735/day\n 4/15-6/15/2012-- less 3916682 or 64207/day\n 4/15-6/15/2013-- less 2800473 or 45909/day\n 4/15-6/15/2014-- less 2846669 or 46666/day\n \n This shows that this year (2014) is most similar to last year (2013) regarding rate of melt. 2014's rate is slightly higher, however, by 757km2 per day. Extrapolating on that rate difference, I estimated how much ice would melt between 7/15/2014 and 9/15/2014 using the historical rate from 2013+757km2 per day.\n \n 7/15/2014:  7745907km2 melting at an estimated rate of 47656km2/day\n 9/15/2014: ~4791235km2\n \n That estimated sea ice extent level is 43696km2 LESS THAN the level on 9/15/2013. I wish I knew more about statistics and standard deviation and the like. The difference between my estimate and the level from last year is only ONE day's worth of melt. If anyone can use this data more effectively, please do! I was really hoping that this method would lead me to a more definitive answer.\n \n ",

        "The simple answer is No, with a small, but not insignificant majority in favor of No camp (i.e. remaining part of the UK).\n \n There are a lot of uncertainties that the Yes (Independence) camp have not managed to overcome in certain demographics of the Scotish vote. \n \n One of the biggest uncertainties is just how much control Scotland, as a smaller nation, would have over its own economic and financial destiny after independence. For example, Alex Salmond, has promised he will keep the pound, however most people know that that is not the issue. Scotland or any counrty for that matter can keep or adopt the pound as its currency. The issue would be what control would Scotland have over its economy and currency if all the decisions about the pound are made in Westminster. Scotland would have no leverage and what is left of the British government/nation would have no motivation to make life easy for the new Scotish government nor would Scotland be part of their priorities when deciding economic matters.\n \n It is no secrete that the UK and the EU have differing economic and political views. Scotland, or at least the SNP wishes to be closer to the EU but if an independent Scotland adopts the pound they would be economically linked (or limited) by UK economic policies but eventually politically linked (or limited) by EU politics. \n \n The other option would be to adopt the Euro. The Yes camp has not opted to go for the Euro as its currency because they know they would have even less control as very small country in the EU. The question that leads from there is, what is the point of independence if you have no real control over your currency or economy? It becomes independence in name but not in practice.\n \n The desire for independence is more emotional than realistic and there is probably a slightly greater majority who do not wish to risk the uncertainty post independence for short term emotional satisfaction.  \n \n ",

However, FJP does not specifically mention religion, faith, sect or denomination, so it was technically legal. Furthermore, the Al-Nour Party, because it also does not specifically mention religion, faith, sect or denomination, is technically legal. If these two religious parties can easily continue being religious parties simply by not mentioning their religion, then I don't see why they would oppose such a toothless ban.

        "Good analysis by everyone so far. Here are some additional thoughts.\n \n The annexation of Crimea is different from the possible annexation of eastern Ukraine: It is more militarily essential to Russia as the home of Russia's fleet (there are no suitable ports in Russia's Black Sea coast); and it was easier to pretend legitimacy based on history and ethnicity: it was not always part of Ukraine, unlike Donetsk and other eastern areas. So I think the same motivations behind the Crimea annexation are not necessarily in play in eastern Ukraine.\n \n Moreover, officially annexing eastern Ukraine is more a direct challenge to the existence of Ukraine as a state, which Crimea was not, so I think there are additional preventive factors in play in Eastern Ukraine. Putin has never given ground on the pretense that the uprising in the East is primarily Ukrainian rather than Russian, despite all evidence to the contrary. In fact, he portrays it as the true, legitimate voice of Ukraine, opposing the illegitimate revolution based in Kiev. Russia may end up with de facto control over much of eastern Ukraine, but as long as Ukraine exists as a state, I see no reason for Putin to give up on his narrative of legitimacy, which emphasizes the role of western meddling in producing the pro-Western Orange and Maidan Revolutions, and denying Russian interference/involvement in the corresponding pro-Russian movements. So making the Russian annexation of eastern Ukraine official would mean giving up one of Putin's primary propaganda mechanisms against the West.\n \n Finally, a common thread of analysis on Putin is that he is challenging traditional international structures and customs. He does not feel the need, for example, to declare or even acknowledge a war in order to wage it. So whatever he seeks to gain by controlling eastern Ukraine, he will unlikely acknowledge it in official terms the West can point to and hang a coalition on. But that is precisely the object of this question. Thus even though I think it *very* likely that Russia, with its vastly superior military and Ukraine's lack of willing military partners, will succeed in *de facto* annexation of additional Ukrainian territory, I judge the question, hanging on the term \"officially\", very unlikely.\n \n Still, Putin is not entirely predictable, and if he continues to see weakness in the West, he may see the benefit of challenging the West with an \"official\" annexation. We've certainly never given him much bother over his unofficial ones, starting with Georgia. This accounts for my 20%.",

        "Daily Forecast\n News Sourcing\n \n ***\n \n One of the more amusing things (or perhaps mystifying if your tastes run that way) about the Greek dust up and election has been the way in which the European left has been shouting that it's all about democracy. If the Greeks aren't allowed to run their economy their way then this will be a denial of that most basic of political rights. So Germany should just open the wallet and get on paying for things. This isn't, of course, how democracy actually works: the demos of Germany has to be included in this decision about what Greece gets to do with German money. The demos of Greece has every right to decide what they want to do with their own money. But not with that of others of course.\n \n And it's that German demos which means that Germany, or at least its politicians, simply cannot give in and give Greece what is being demanded. Simply because the Germans themselves, the people who go out and earn the money that becomes the taxes that Greece is insisting should pay its debts, don't want that to happen. As this interesting little article says:\n \n Berlin cabdriver Jens Mueller says he's had it with the Greek government and he doesn't want Germany to send any more of his tax money to be squandered in Athens.\n \n \"They've got a lot of hubris and arrogance, being in the situation they're in and making all these demands,\" said Mueller, 49, waiting for fares near the Brandenburg Gate. \"Maybe it's better for Greece to just leave the euro.\"\n \n Mueller's sentiment is shared by a majority of Germans. A poll published March 13 by public broadcaster ZDF found 52 percent of his countrymen no longer want Greece to remain in Europe's common currency, up from 41 percent last month. The shift is due to a view held by 80 percent of Germans that Greece's government \"isn't behaving seriously toward its European partners.\"\n \n Well, OK, cab drivers are actually on oath to provide good quotes for visiting reporters*. But that public opinion there really is something that German politicians need to take account of (as in any good democracy they should, in fact in any good democracy they should be positively petrified of the opinions of the electors). And if the German taxpayers and voters are not just not willing to pay for Greece's debts but are actively supporting the idea that Greece should leave the euro then there's really very little indeed that can be done in the negotiations.\n \n \n There is, of course, always the time tested political expedient of simply lying to the people but this has already been done to about the extent that it can be. There's one real number that is sticking in the minds of that German electorate: the total amount of the Greek debt. Not that everyone could immediately tell you what the number is but the news that it was being reduced would pretty quickly get around and cause ructions. Those ructions almost certainly including the unelection of whichever politicians had agreed to it. Thus we've had (lying is too strong a word as yet, given how commonplace this sort of thing is in politic) the, umm, imprecision about certain portions of the deal that Greece has been offered. For extending the maturity of the loans and reducing the interest rates on them has exactly the same economic effect as reducing the principal of the loans. We're just substituting inflation as the mechanism of the write down for the express political acknowledgement of it. But this has been taken as far as it can be. The German electorate simply isn't going to accept any more reductions in what must be repaid to the German taxpayer.\n \n Which brings us back to that point from the leftists about democracy. Yep, OK, so democracy should win. But whose democracy? That of the Greeks who have already spent the money? Or of the Germans who might end up having to pay for it?\n \n ****\n \n Senior German politicians have broken ranks with Angela Merkel's government to demand that Germany pay reparations to Greece for Nazi crimes committed during the Second World War.\n \n The move by key figures from two parties that are Ms Merkel's junior coalition partners broke a 25-year taboo on a subject that Berlin has consistently maintained is \"closed\"  - and followed repeated demands by the new Greek government for war compensation payments to help offset its deepening national debt.\n \n \"In my view the issue is absolutely clear, we should provide financial help for the victims and their relatives,\" said Gesine Schwan, 71, a senior Social Democrat who ran twice for the office of German president. \"It is a matter of recognising that we committed terrible crimes in Greece.\"\n \n Her view was echoed by the deputy Social Democrat leader, Ralf Stegner. \"I believe we should be leading the discussion about reparations,\" he told Der Spiegel, though he added: \"We should not link the issue with the current debate about the euro crisis.\"\n \n April 1941: Men who stayed to defend the Greek city of Salonika are finally captured by the overwhelming Nazi presence (Keystone/Getty Images) The Greens' parliamentary party leader, Anton Hofreiter, said: \"Germany cannot just sweep Greece's demand off the table. This chapter is not closed, neither from a moral nor legal standpoint.\" He said Ms Merkel's government would be \"well advised to seek a solution\".\n \n The proposal - likely to be met with a frosty response by German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble - appeared to open the door to compensation claims from other countries occupied by the Nazis, including more than 20 current members of the European Union, if accepted. Conservative politicians in Poland previously made similar demands which went unanswered.\n \n Nazi Germany murdered thousands of Greek citizens during its occupation of the country from 1941 to 1944. Adolf Hitler's regime also forced the Greek national bank to supply Germany with credits worth the equivalent of between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac8bn and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac11bn (\u00c2\u00a35.75bn to \u00c2\u00a38bn) at current value, and never repaid the sum. Since its election, the new Greek government led by Alexis Tsipras has reopened the issue of German war reparations, arguing that compensation from Berlin could be used to ward off the prospects of Greek bankruptcy. Last week the Greek justice minister threatened moves to confiscate German property if the issue is not resolved.\n \n \n ****\n BRUSSELS-Technical talks between Greece and its creditors aren't going well, officials said Wednesday, with each blaming the other for the snags in crucial negotiations.\n \n Teams from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund are getting very little information on the government's finances and other key topics in Athens, two European officials said.\n \n \"The line was that the Greeks aren't cooperating,\" said one of the officials, summarizing the institutions' account during a teleconference among senior eurozone finance ministry officials on Tuesday.\n \n A Greek official said the technical teams had gone beyond their role as fact-finders and had sought to intervene in politics, continuing a frequent line of complaint from Athens about the so-called troika of inspectors.\n \n The technical work is key to figuring out when Greece may run out of money and whether the rest of the eurozone is prepared to provide further support to the left-wing government.\n \n Eurozone finance ministers agreed last month to extend Greece's \u00e2\u0082\u00ac240 billion ($254 billion) bailout by four months until the end of June. However, there has been little progress on defining reform measures in return for sustained aid, raising concerns over Greece's future in the eurozone.\n \n During the teleconference, the Greek representative said his government wasn't prepared to talk about the country's finances with technical experts and instead wanted European Union leaders to discuss the issue at a summit in Brussels, one of the European officials said.\n \n \"There was a general feeling that the Greek side is completely out of touch with reality,\" said the official.\n \n 'This is the first bill in five years that doesn't take something from the people, but will offer them something.'\n -Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told lawmakers on Wednesday, referring to a new bill that would give free electricity and food stamps to low-income households. Representatives of the three institutions said that, based on the limited information they have, the Greek government will be able to sustain payments only for another few weeks, according to the official. They also asked the Greek government to hold off on moving ahead with bill that would provide new support for the poor, until they've had time to assess its impact on the budget, in line with the agreement on extending the bailout.\n \n The Parliament in Athens is due to vote later Wednesday on the bill, which would give free electricity and food stamps to low-income households in an effort to offset the impact of Greece's protracted austerity program. Those measures are expected to cost around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac200 million and the government says they will be offset by other cutbacks that include reducing spending at ministries and adopting a new, more transparent system for awarding state procurement contracts.\n \n \"This is the first bill in five years that doesn't take something from the people but will offer them something,\" Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told lawmakers.\n \n Mr. Tsipras also said Greece plans to push ahead with a parliamentary vote later this week to reopen the state broadcaster and offer taxpayers more lenient terms on arrears owed, without having been given the green light from international creditors.\n \n The location and content of talks has been a sticking point over the last two months. Greece had pushed for the talks to be held in Brussels, saying the troika's previous forays in the Greek capital have been disruptive and sparked protests.\n \n But European officials insisted that some experts would need to be in Greece to access key data on government accounts, for instance, and to speak to experts at ministries.\n \n In the hope of finding a political solution, Mr. Tsipras has asked to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on the sidelines of an EU summit later this week.\n \n If confirmed, the meeting would happen on Thursday or Friday on the margins of the summit.\n \n Greece faces yet another deadline Friday, as it has to repay some \u00e2\u0082\u00ac350 million to the International Monetary Fund and refinance some \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.6 billion of short-term notes.",
        "The OPCW decision required that mustard agent and key binary chemical weapon components be removed from Syrian soil by 31 December 2013, and be destroyed outside Syria by 31 March 2014. As of today, only 11% of the total chemicals in Syria's possession are reported to have been shipped overseas, so the delay is already over 6 weeks. Destruction of these critical chemicals outside Syria is still feasible, and could happen if enough pressure is built up on the Assad regime, particularly through Russia, to make it feel insecure. However, renewed fighting will hinder safe transport of chemicals to the port of Latakia (this was the reason given by Syria for the earlier delay).   Despite the above, I'm being more optimistic than JL at the moment. I think the Syrian government could still buckle under pressure from the international community.

        "The WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement is an international agreement to reduce trade barriers.  It was originally agreed to by the Ninth Ministerial Conference in Bali, Indonesia in December 2013.  However, as mentioned in the more info section, (the new government in) India refused to approve the agreement on July 31, 2014.\n The main issue is the allowed public stockpiling of food grains and subsidies for same.  The new agreement would severely limit India's ability to subsidize its domestic grain producers.  Some other countries have similar concerns.  The US and other developed countries would prefer the agreement as it now stands. See http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-why-is-india-not-agreeing-to-the-wto-trade-facilitation-agreement-2005181 for a summary.\n There will be further talks starting in September aimed at resolving the disagreement.  One way would be to modify the existing food subsidy rules; the current rules allow subsidies based on 1986-88 grain prices, which were much lower, effectively restricting them severely.  If new rules are approved at the same time, that would substantially address India's concerns, and the agreement would likely be approved.  It might not be approved even in this case; India reversed its stance on the current agreement.\n On the other hand, if no new food subsidy rules are approved, then it is hard to see why India would suddenly be willing to approve the TFA.  The most likely scenario for approval in this case is that India would gain some other related concession.",

These parts enjoy greater autonomy that in my opinion they don't want to risk by \"offending\" the intl community by declaring an independent state.  Thus from the three regions, here is my take: Turkey - Gvmt and Kurds will agree on more liberties and autonomy in exchange for Ocalan's vow to reduce/renounce violence and not seek independence. 0% chance. Syria - with the gvmt still being firmly in control, I doubt that secession of a partial region would go anywhere in regards of intl recognition. Also, if there is a transition of power, I believe that Syria's cohesion is strong enough not to break the country apart. Very low chance. Iraq - The country would have to fall apart and in the mess the Kurds (or for the sake of IARPA technicality, a Shia or Sunni state) would need to emerge as a separate state. Now there is a lot of violence etc, but I expect the likelihood of Iraq breaking apart in the near future to be low. But some percentages to hedge against the chaos...",

Waves of attacks by Muslim and Christian militias have killed hundreds, if not thousands, in Central African Republic since rebels seized power in March 2012. A UN official warned on Thursday of the risk of a genocide.  Georgieva, who has visited CAR twice since the crisis erupted, told Reuters in an interview that initially people were wary of speaking out about the sectarian violence because they were concerned it would become a self-fulfilling prophecy, like \"pulling the tail of the devil\".  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is due to submit a report to the Security Council next month with recommendations for a possible UN peacekeeping force that would take over from the African troops.  \"The option of a UN peacekeeping operation must be looked into very seriously,\" Georgieva said.  \"While it is very good for Africans to help each other, Central African Republic, being where it is, makes it more difficult, more complex for an African solution because of the complicated relations between Chad and Central African Republic,\" she said.  The United Nations said on Tuesday that a UN human rights team has gathered testimony that Chadian citizens, including peacekeepers, carried out mass killings.  CAR - with a population of 4.6-million - lies at a crossroads of conflict in the heart of Africa, with Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia to the east, the Islamist threat in the Sahel region to the north-west and the revolts of the Great Lakes to the south-east.  \"The Central African Republic is bad, but it is not yet Somalia, it is not yet al-Qaeda, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram territory. We act now, it doesn't turn into one, but it would take a very strong effort,\" Georgieva said. ",

Syria has vowed commitment to the destruction of its chemical weapons despite difficulties caused by the conflict in the country.  Russia, which was instrumental in brokering the deal, played down the delays and said Syria would still move out a large quantity of chemicals by the end of February. So neither Russia nor Syria are de-committing; there have been some logistic/security issues with meeting these deadlines in a war zone.  No reason for Syria not to intend to make the deadline and with Russian backing I believe they will get there. However, here have been reports that Bashar Assad's regime is stockpiling the weaponry for use in case the country is partitioned.A report in the Times of London cited unnamed Russian and Israeli sources saying Syria is working with Iran and North Korea to upgrade its stockpile to use as an \"insurance policy\" or deterrent to defend Assad's Alawite homeland in northwestern Syria from being overrun by regime opponents.  So going in cautiously here on the affirmative side until I can get a better feel for this one--the key part of the question refers to destruction by March 31 and not shipped out of the country for destruction by March 31--need to look into how long it will take to destroy once these components leave the country.

Among those that would satisfy this question, the top candidates are China, Japan and South Korea (I doubt Putin would want the distraction and he would not have much to gain).  China's president met with South Korea's president in July 2014.

Not sure if its a plus for Kim, or if he prefers to keep China at a distance, figuratively.  South Korea would only happen if there were some broader diplomatic progress - always possible, has happened before, but nothing in the press suggests that right now.  On the other hand, the question has a long time frame, so its possible.  Wildcard is Japan.

We see that a projection based on the 2013 figures is higher than a projected average for 2007-2013. Assuming that 2014 is within two standard deviations of the 2007-2013 average, there is a high chance that its trend line will be lower than that of 2013.\n \n Granted, we should continue to watch the maps and ensure that the trend is following pace, but this seems like a likely event.\n \n http://www.arcus.org/sipn/sea-ice-outlook/2014/july\n http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/",

        "http://english.capital.gr/News.asp?id=2270199\n \n Approval rates for Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff have reached historic lows amid economic troubles and a corruption scandal, reducing her chances of approving austerity measures in Congress.\n \n A new poll released Wednesday showed that only 12% of 2,002 respondents across the country said Ms. Rousseff's administration was \"good or excellent,\" compared with 40% in a poll published in December, while 64% considered her administration \"bad,\" up from 27% in December.\n \n The poll's result is the lowest for any president since 1995, the oldest data immediately available from CNI. It comes after massive protests that brought more than a million Brazilians to the streets in March to protest against corruption and other issues.\n \n The protests may have \"contaminated the results,\" said CNI Survey Manager Renato da Fonseca.\n \n The poll, though, reinforces a downward trend in approval rates showed by other recent surveys, and adds to a difficult period for the leader of Latin America's largest economy.\n \n It comes in the wake of a tight and tense election in October, when Ms. Rousseff narrowly won a second four-year term amid economic weakness, high inflation and a widening budget gap that made credit-rating agencies put Brazil on watch for a downgrade to junk status.\n \n But the economy isn't the only problem. In fact, the poll showed that news about investigations of alleged corruption at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled oil company known as Petrobras, was cited by 28% of respondents, making it the leading theme in their minds. Inflation, the leading economic theme, was mentioned by 4% of the sample.\n \n Prosecutors say that billions of dollars were skimmed from Petrobras by executives who funneled part of the allegedly illegal proceeds back to government-supporting parties. Ms. Rousseff was energy minister and Petrobras chairwoman for much of that period, before becoming Brazil's president and has said she didn't know about the alleged wrongdoing.\n \n Although she hasn't been implicated in the investigations, high-profile politicians linked to the Workers' Party have. Opposition parties have called for Ms. Rousseff's impeachment.\n \n It is also possible that Ms. Rousseff's rates have hit bottom. CNI's Mr. Fonseca said that he \"won't be surprised\" if the next poll in June shows a recovery in Ms. Rousseff's ratings. \"The evaluation is too low. The result was inflated by the street protests,\" he said.\n \n But the result poses new challenges for a president who will be struggling to establish her legacy in the next four years.\n \n As she started the new term in January, the economy was heading to recession and consumer-price increases neared 8%. Interest rates are now at 12.75% and rising.\n \n The re-elected president called on a conservative banker, Joaquim Levy, to run the Finance Ministry and increase government savings, something the government hopes will help tame inflation.\n \n While many of her critics were pleasantly surprised by the leftist leader's about-face, the move upset many of her voters who believed her Workers' Party would double down on a policy of heavy government spending to pump up growth.\n \n Among respondents who said they voted for Ms. Rousseff, only 22% now say her government is good, compared with 63% in December, right before the austerity measures kicked in. In the same group, 42% said they trust the president, down from 80% in December.\n \n Mr. Levy has acted to increase taxes and cut spending. But some of the new measures need lawmakers' approval, something that is harder to obtain when the president has such low approval rates.\n \n \"During the campaign, [Ms. Rousseff] said things that are the opposite of what we see her doing now.  The people don't forgive\" this type of behavior.\n \n \"When you lose people's approval, government allies start to jump ship.\n \n COMMENT:  Rousseff's selection of Levy for Finance Minister seems to have been a good one, and an invitation to the US by Obama may give her a big boost.  I need to research the history of coups and impeach\u0010ments\u0010 in Brazil, however.\n \n I don't think that this is going to happen, but this is one of those questions that it pays to front-load, so I'll say 50%\n \n  \n ",

        "NATO must invoke Article 5 in the event Russia attacks any member of the alliance. Will it happen? In the light of recent Russian activities, it would be smart to challenge NATO - but with avoidance of direct conflict (only Cold War style). That's what Russians are already doing.\n \n For years Putin has put his best efforts to weaken NATO. In his many years Putin not only showed psychotic personality traits but also having a dream to destroy the alliance. After events in Ukraine, you might expect this crazy Kremlin thug to go with a simple attack on a small member, hoping big NATO allies would sacrifice, instead of going into lethal confrontation with Russia.\n \n Three targets - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (all together Baltic States), formerly occupied by USSR. If there's any chance Russia attacks a member of the alliance - Latvia could go first: almost half of population is Russian (even though they barely relate themselves to Putin's regime). Russians surveillance have tripled along Latvia's borders both on land and in the Baltic Sea.\n \n Estonia would likely go next - around 25% of population are Russians, and the pressure from Kremlin is extensive. Within the borders Russians have significant war bases (also known as 'training camps'). Just to show the scale of provocations, back in September Russian agents kidnapped one of Estonian intelligence officials in a cross-border raid (on the eve of NATO meeting in Tallinn), Russia accused Estonia in return that this man was caught spying on its territory.\n \n Lithuania would be the last target, also most counter-aggressive of the Baltic States, with 'iron lady' president, re-elected for the 2nd term, to pull the trigger in self-defense against Russia if needed. Only 6% of population are Russians, but Russian cultural influence, just as in other two Baltic States,  remains strong. Moreover, Lithuanians, among neighboring countries, are most sensitive to Russian propaganda. There's a constant verbal war between Kremlin and Vilnius, the latest incident occurred today when NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg visited Lithuanian bases and president Grybauskaite proclaimed Russia having pro-terrorist like symptoms, Kremlin politicians asked Russian Duma to break diplomatic relations with Lithuania in return.\n \n No one knows what Putin will choose to do next. Some say Putin himself doesn't know it, and his spontaneous choices prove that.\n \n However, it's still highly unlikely that Article 5 will be invoked within the time frame provided. After WW2, we have witnessed significant amount of intimidation from aggressive dictators, but no major alliance have been brought into battle. Here are other reasons on why Article 5 shall not be invoked:\n 1. US has ensured wider, more equipped NATO presence in the Baltic States (also Poland, just in case if history repeats itself)\n 2. After the annexation of Crimea NATO takes the Baltic air-policing mission seriously, doesn't indulge to Russian provocations\n 3. Russia fears Baltics could become energetically independent, further threat would distance already damaged cooperation. Just recently, Lithuania have installed liquefied natural gas terminal which is able to provide up to 75% of gas needed to all Baltic States. As a result, the only monopoly Gazprom has discounted gas by 25%. If Baltics manage to become independent on power supply, Russia would be hugely disarmed.\n 4. Russia is officially heading into recession, new laws deter from any investment or healthy norms of living, therefore domestic troubles would inevitably play a role sooner or later.",

In theory, the breakeven between expansion and contraction is 50. I've attached a chart of the services PMI along with the manufacturing PMI, which has been oscillating around 50. I'm thinking a better way to look at this is how much these indexes are deviating from the averages, so I've added those lines as well.\n \n Personally, I'm skeptical how much these purchasing manager surveys are reliable gauges of China's economy (the equivalent in the US, Europe, and elsewhere have far more variation over the same time period).

        "This forecast consists of two parts: the timing of the decision and the outcome of the decision.  First, will the WTO issue a ruling in the rare earth metals complaint before 31 DEC 2013?  Once the WTO dispute panel is established, it has six months to issue a ruling, and according to the WTO site (http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/disp1_e.htm), the process takes one year without appeal or 15 months with an appeal.  The panel was formed on 23 July 2012, so it would seem that even with an appeal, the panel would issue some kind of ruling no later than late October 2013.  I factored in uncertainties and forecast that there is a 95% chance the WTO will issue a ruling before December 2013.      Second, will the ruling be in favor of the EU and against China?  In reading the history of this specific dispute (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/business/global/us-europe-and-japan-escalate-rare-earth-dispute-with-china.html) I contend there are several reasons to forecast a strong (90%) chance that China will lose the complaint.  For starters, the Chinese restrictions have been in place for more than six years, so there is ample data to bolster claims of economic damages.  Additionally, besides the EU, there 17 third party litigants to this case (including the US), so the damages are widespread.  Finally, China has a monopoly on the production of rare earth metals, so it will be difficult for the Chinese to defend the charge that the country's leaders are not abusing the monopoly as a way of forcing direct foreign investment in China.  Overall, these estimates lead me to forecast in September 2012 with an 85% probability that the WTO will rule in favor of the EU by 31 DEC 2013.",

Thirty years ago this month, Britain and China signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, under which London agreed to restore Hong Kong to China in 1997 and Beijing spelled out its policy of \"one country two systems\" for the then-British colony, which would \"enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defense affairs which are the responsibilities of the Central People's Government\" for 50 years, that is, until 2047.\n \n In July, the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee announced that it would conduct an inquiry into the United Kingdom's relations with Hong Kong. According to the committee, the inquiry will consider how the British government monitors the implementation of the Joint Declaration, as well as the UK's relations with Hong Kong, including economic and cultural ties.\n \n Last week, the committee ran into a brick wall. China told the committee its members would be denied visas for Hong Kong.\n \n This is the first time that any country - including China - had banned Members of Parliament from conducting a visit as part of an inquiry.\n \n But more is at stake than the pride of British M.P.'s. In announcing the ban China in effect asserted that the Joint Declaration \"is now void and only covered the period from the signing in 1984 until the handover in 1997.\"\n \n If true, that is very troubling since the Joint Declaration made it clear that China's commitment was to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy until 2047. That is to say, the Joint Declaration, an international treaty lodged with the United Nations, will not lapse until then.\n \n For China to declare that the treaty is now void is tantamount to unilaterally abrogating a treaty. It calls to mind words spoken by then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Hong Kong in 1982, after her meeting with paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in Beijing.\n \n The Iron Lady said: \"If a country will not stand by one treaty, it would not stand by another treaty.\" Speaking about the UK, she said, \"We stick by our treaties.\"\n \n COMMENT:  The UK says that this isn't just about refusing to issue visas,  it's about if China sticks by its treaties, so the question has huge ramifications.  I hope that face-saving ways are found to resolve it, like maybe allowing only ONE member of Parliament to enter.\n \n I'm front-loading this IFP.

NATO has reported that some of these units are artillery units that are firing on Ukrainian National forces from both within Ukrainian territory and from Russian territory.\n  I believe Russia will continue to provide arms,equipment and manpower to pro separatist \"militias\". Russia will also utilize direct support in the form of artillery or possibly airstrikes,methods which can be denied if accused. I also feel that the probability of a lethal confrontation will increase as Ukrainian forces gain against separatist forces. \n ",

        "I need to know more about the consensus in the Obama administration. Most of the world waits to see what the US will do before this type of incursion into foreign territory. \n \n It is important to remember international law. There are really only two basic means to justify a military invasion on foreign soil: (1) UN Security Council authorization and (2) self-defense, including collective self-defense. This means that we cannot intervene legally without Syria's authorization unless we have a majority of the UNSC, including all permanent members, authorize it first. Syria has already explicitly refused international help, at least from us: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/syria-says-its-ready-to-cooperate-to-fight-islamist-militants/article20189234/ Obama is typically respectful of international law, as is most of the rest of the world. The loan exception capable of such an attack is Israel, and they have very little incentive to help stabilize the Syrian government.\n \n Even after UNSC Resolution 1973, Obama was very tentative and skeptical of attacking Libya, for instance. Biden, if I remember correctly, was plainly against it. Clinton was for it. Clinton is no longer a member of the administration, while Biden obviously remains.\n \n The last important fact to remember is the baseline US activity in the country. We have been aiding certain \"moderate\" rebels for a long time. They are already attacking the IS rebels (eg. This: http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/08/28/found_the_islamic_state_terror_laptop_of_doom_bubonic_plague_weapons_of_mass_destruction_exclusive). The existing Obama administration strategy seems to be to try to help the \"moderates\" end up on top of the rubble when the civil war concludes. This type of covert activity is explicitly excluded in the clarifications.\n \n With the US government's policy of providing aid and monitoring the situation, I think the only way the US would intervene would be if the situation deteriorates. Even then, the US would likely wait until the Syrian government approved it out of desperation. Even a UNSC resolution would probably hinge on Syrian support, as Russia, a permanent member with veto power, is a Syrian ally.\n \n The last possibility I can imagine is that Syria consents to an intervention of Russia or a Middle Eastern ally. Again, this would be likely only in desperation.",

It's hard to have much insight into the DPRK regime.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand:\n\n- DPRK attacked ROK twice in 2010 - sinking the Cheonan in March and bombarding Big Yeonpyeong island in November. ROK response was measured.\n\n- KJU was announced as successor in September 2010, and made a 4 star general. KJU was implicated in the Big Yeonpyeong bombardment, presumably to bolster his credentials as successor.\n\n- DPRK is an isolationist regime but uses the threat of external attack as a unifying force. The military is central to the regime. A small military excursion against ROK could be used to shore up the new leader or by generals to assert the role of the military in the new regime (either under the umbrella of the Kim dynasty or outside it).\n\n- ROK clearly considers this a risk - it put its military on alert following news of the death of KJI.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n- KJU was educated overseas and is considered by a few (very few) to be a potential reformer.\n\n- DPRK and ROK relations have generally improved over the past decade, the recent attacks notwithstanding.

In recent months, it appears they have been content with the lower prices to put stress on the frackers.  Limiting production now would mean an abandonment of this effort.

        "I was waiting for this question, or one similar. The news first thing this morning does not seem to point so much to the release of bailout funds as it does to the release of Greece from the EU. \n \n The Wall Street Journal reports:\n \n http://www.wsj.com/articles/technical-talks-on-greeces-bailout-not-going-well-officials-say-1426672526\n \n This article does not paint a pretty picture for Greece.  They are upset about the inspectors and the grim specter of austerity. What they need to do (a la Ireland) is complain about the inspectors, suck it up, adopt austerity and just get on with it. It does not appear that they are ready to do this. Certain actions have telegraphed their lack of respect for the process and their unwillingness to step into line with the rest of Europe.\n \n \"\"The line was that the Greeks aren't cooperating,\" one of the officials said, summarizing the institutions' account during a teleconference the day before among senior eurozone finance ministry officials.\n \n A Greek official said the technical teams had gone beyond their role as fact-finders and had sought to intervene in politics, continuing a frequent line of complaint from Athens about the so-called troika of inspectors.\"\n \"I continue to be worried,\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Wednesday about the talks. \"I'm not happy with the progress that's been achieved over the last few days.\" \"\n \n \"Representatives of the three institutions said that, based on the limited information they have, the Greek government would be able to sustain payments only for another few weeks, according to the one official.\n \n They also asked Greece to hold off on a bill that would provide new support for the poor until they have had time to assess its impact on the budget, in line with a deal to extend the bailout.\n \n But early Thursday, lawmakers in Athens passed the bill, the new government's first. The measures, which provide subsidized electricity and food stamps to low-income households, are expected to cost around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac200 million ($213 million).\"\n \n The New York Times takes it one step further:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/business/international/warnings-raised-of-a-greek-exit-from-the-euro.html?_r=0\n \n Warnings Raised of a Greek Exit From the Euro\n \n \"Just a few weeks ago, fears that Greece might exit the euro union subsided when Europe extended its financial bailout. But as a new war of words escalates between Athens and its creditors, talk of a \"Grexit\" is heating up.\n \n In the last several days, European and American banks, think tanks and ratings agencies have issued a fresh round of warnings and studies calculating the damage to the currency union if Greece were to default on its debts or stop using the euro.\"\n \n \"One of the main sticking points is Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's pushing ahead with an anti-austerity agenda that creditors say conflicts with pledges he made on Feb. 20 in winning an agreement to let Greece extend its 240 billion euro, or $254 billion, bailout program for four months. That deal was crucial to giving Greece the ability to unlock loan money it badly needs. But so far, no funds have been forthcoming.\n \n On Wednesday, Greece's Parliament approved a number of anti-poverty measures despite warnings from creditors that the legislation ran contrary to the overall package of changes Greece had agreed last month to adopt.\n \n And it probably did not help Greece's debt diplomacy that members of Mr. Tsipras's Syriza party were among the thousands of European demonstrators in Frankfurt on Wednesday protesting, amid tear gas, European Central Bank policies.\"\n \n None of this seems to be the way forward in the recovery process. Many of the points in Syriza's 40 point (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-01-29/syrizas-original-40-point-manifesto) plan seem to be coming to the forefront, many of these which were not main talking points during the election for the reason that they are ...well...bat-shit crazy. What Greece need to do now is let the inspectors crawl deep inside their system and suggest reforms that WILL be implemented. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the chosen path of the Greek government.\n \n \"He has persuaded Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany; President Francois Hollande of France; the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi; and others to discuss the Greek crisis directly with him. Whether he will clinch a deal to unlock funds and prevent a wider crisis remains to be seen.\"\n \n Europe will only be willing to throw money at an increasing crisis for so long, then it will be time to cut the cord...I think this will be sooner rather than later based on recent developments.\n \n The Guardian is offering live updates of the meetings at:\n \n http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/mar/19/eu-leaders-summit-greek-bailout-talks-live-updates\n \n 12:20\n European Council president Donald Tusk has played down the importance of tonight's talks, saying that it's not the last opportunity to resolve the Greek crisis.\n \n EU'S TUSK SAYS: THURSDAY MEETING WITH TSIPRAS IS NOT LAST CHANCE FOR GREECE\n EU'S TUSK SAYS: NOBODY WANTS A GREXIT OR A GREXIDENT\n EU'S TUSK SAYS: INFORMAL MEETING WILL NOT BE A DECISIVE MEETING, WILL NOT TAKE DECISIONS\n \n The above update seems to downplay the potential impacts of the meetings, but they will set the stage for subsequent actions.\n \n The more I read about this the more it seems like Greece is going to try to renegotiate the conditions of their bailout every chance they get.\n \n If Greece turns up at the summit today and promises to adhere to all conditions of their agreed bailout, then there may be funds released.  The problem with this is that they will not be telling the truth.  The conditions of the bailout run contrary to Syriza's manifesto.  Understandably, there will be some items that will be dropped, but they have already introduced a bill that the EU had told them to back off on... and I believe this will be the first of many. Will Europe recognize this and try to reel them in...I don't know.\n \n \n Reuters reports this morning:\n \n http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/03/19/eurozone-greece-idINKBN0MF13U20150319\n \n \"(Reuters) - Euro zone leaders will tell Greece on Thursday that time and patience are running out for its leftist-led government to implement agreed reforms to avert a looming cash crunch that could force it out of the single currency.\n \n Greece has been kept from bankruptcy by two international bailouts but now risks running out of money within weeks if it does not receive more funds. Greek banks reported the largest deposit withdrawals since Feb. 20, a sign savers are worried about the outlook for the country's finances and institutions.\"\n \n \"I will repeat to him what I've already told him twice: Greece must undertake the necessary reforms, Greece must ensure that the commitments it made to the Eurogroup in 2012 and more recently are followed up on,\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told France's Europe 1 radio.\n \n German Chancellor Angela Merkel delivered the same message in a speech to parliament ahead of the late-night Brussels talks and a crucial visit by Tsipras to Berlin next Monday, saying the crisis could only be overcome if Greece stuck to agreements.\n \n No one should expect a solution from Thursday's session or her meeting with Tsipras next week, which offered \"time to talk to each other in detail and perhaps also to argue\", she said.\"\n \n It doesn't look like there will be any action at this summit based on the comments by various leaders in Europe, but the gauntlet will be thrown down. \n \n All of the mass media is reporting the same information.  he main points that stand out are:\n \n Greece is not allowing the agreed upon full access to the financial institutions.\n \n Greece wants to implement points on the 40 point plan whether they comply with the agreed upon austerity measures or not.\n \n Greece does not want to be told what to do.\n \n Europe wants to tell Greece what to do, how to do it and when to do it...if they are to continue to fund them.\n \n There are many micro issues in addition to these, but that sums it up for the moment.\n \n I've included a few more sources that rehash the primary sources for your reading pleasure :\n \n \n From the Lexington Herald Leader (Source AP)\n http://www.kentucky.com/2015/03/18/3753448/greek-leader-defiant-ahead-of.html\n \n Australias \"The Monthly\"\n \n My big fat Greek calamity - Part two\n There are now no more good options left for Greece\n \n https://www.themonthly.com.au/blog/satyajit-das/2015/19/2015/1426720921/my-big-fat-greek-calamity-part-two\n \n From Telesur:\n \n \"EU Threatens Possible Eurozone Exit for Greece\"\n \n http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/EU-Threatens-Possible-Eurozone-Exit-for-Greece-20150318-0007.html\n \n An alternative view from DW:\n \n Greece wants utility firms to lend cash\n \n The Greek government keeps bending over backwards to get hold on fresh cash badly needed to keep the struggling nation afloat financially.

The author of the compilation notes the figures are incomplete. But the numbers appear to confirm cobbler's observation that terrorist attacks that result in five or more deaths are extremely rare.  The compilation does not identify which terrorist group is responsible for how many deaths. What are the odds that, in any of the seven months with 5+ fatalities, 5 deaths within a 24 hour period can be attributed to the Islamic Jihad?  That's not to say the Islamic Jihad is not violating the cease fire.

        "When you consider that the purpose of political carpetbagger Marina Silva's candidacy in 2010 was to throw the election into a second round, this is almost a certainty.

If you read the New York Times coverage of the Eduardo Campos plane crash by Simon Romero, you will see how it gives the feel that Brazil and the United States are distant neighors. It can offer one a reminder that U.S. media coverage of Brazil and all of \"Latin\" America does have a hegemonic dimension. \n \n Official Brazil likes to showcase Marina as the poor girl from the Amazon who was found a future holding the clipboard for rubber tappers union activist Chico Mendez when Chico was on the way out and Lula was on the way in.\n \n Had Campos not crashed and burned in the Cessna jet she would still be a vice presidential candidate brought on as a \"token\" by the suave, elite Campos, who comes from a prominent white northern Brazilian family and at age 49 was doing a trial run and looking to make a serious run for the presidency in the future. The ticket, PSB (Brazilian Socialist Party) Campos, and Marina was running around 8 to 10 percent by Brazil's leading polling organization, DATAFOLHA, which is connected to the major daily newspaper and web paper Folha de Sao Paulo. \n \n Marina tried to front her own party \"The Sustainablility Network\" which was really a cover for her effiliation and political agenda with the American-advised Brazilan Assemblies of God churches. When she didn't make the cut to get on the ballot she was just hanging out there, a political orphan, and class act Campos and his team brought her on board to keep her in the game and use her image to help his candidacy.\n \n Had Campos lived, the 8-10 percent of the votes DATAFOLHA says he conrolled with Marina as his running mate would have been horsetraded to the highest bidder in the second round. Marina is a snake in the grass.\n \n These are my personal views. I suggest you draw your own conclusions with your own processes.",

The likelihood of a regional crisis involving Iran; and 4. PIJ's freedom of movement in Egyptian Sinai.

One source expects the Kurdish group to finish second:  [Same story that Brett linked to in his Forum post, but at a different site] http://www.aina.org/news/20140413132051.htm  \"The State of Law coalition headed by the current Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, along with its National Allied Coalition (Shiite), are likely to receive most of the votes.

Although the HCE claims that distribution has since increased, all available figures show the percentage could only jump to 30-35%. Furthermore, it is believed that the vast majority of those whodid receive their cards are members or supporters of the parties already participating in the political process. More damning still is the collective decision by the HCE's members to resign, on account of government pressure. Later they were forced to withdraw their resignations, again due to the prime minister's interference and control over the HCE (which is directly attached to his office, not to the process).  \"Furthermore, due to the high level of corruption, most of the parties taking part in the political process, and their members, have accumulated huge fortunes which enable them to bribe voters with ease in a country where the majority live in poverty.\"  Opinion piece that suggests that al-Maliki will win, and that that is not a good thing for Iraq's security:  http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2014/04/iraqs-elections-setting-worst-case-scenario/82390/  \"In hindsight, the image of Iraq that emerged from the hopeful 2010 national elections seems like a mirage.\"  \"As Iraqis prepare for another national election at the end of this month, an increasingly authoritarian Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his Shiite-led government appear poised to further consolidate power at the expense of Sunnis and Kurds.\"  Article suggesting that terrorist attacks against Sunnis are likely to depress the Sunni vote, thereby (indirectly) helping al-Maliki's coalition:  http://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/2014/04/16/elections-in-iraq-and-uncertainty  \"ISIL members are said to be distributing leaflets in Sunni-majority areas threatening the public not to participate in the elections.

Also, with Sochi olympics, perhaps they'll try to push this through UNSC to reduce any friction.  Hmm.  The first article says:  \"Once a UN mandate has been obtained for the mission, which may be approved as early as Thursday in New York, EU planners hope to get troops on the ground by late February, diplomats said.\"  Does this count as a UN mission?  I suppose not, based on \"Reports of a UNSC resolution endorsing or providing material support for a non-U.N. peacekeeping operation (e.g., a French or African Union mission) will not resolve the question.\"  This actually makes me think more NO.

If this was essentially a two person race with some minor candidates, it would be more likely that she could make up this shortfall as the election date drew near. Right now it looks like there are two strong challengers in Neves and Silva who are currently polling in the 20% range.  There is also a wildcard to consider.  A party can change candidates up to 3 weeks prior to the election.  Rousseff's predecessor was Luca Da Silva who was well liked and had a 80% approval rating.  If Rousseff's ratings were to drop substantially prior to the 3 week deadline, there is a possibility the party's candidate could change making a runoff less likely.",
        "The first thing to keep in mind is that we're talking about a very long timeline here -- more than a year. A high level of certainty in either direction this early seems unwise.   Iran has used the threat of blockading the strait for years -- this would have a major negative impact on global oil supplies -- particularly in the format of \"if Israel/the US attack us, then we will blockade\" threat. The US has said that such a blockade would be seen as an act of war.  HuffPost had this interesting note: \"Last week, a group of Iranian lawmakers backed proposals that would push government to close the waterway. Yet, Iran's parliament has not taken any action on the case and it's unclear whether lawmakers could force such a military move on the strait, which is jointly controlled by Iran and Oman.\"  In any case, from my brief research, it seems to me that the situation between the US, Israel, Iran and Oman would have to deteriorate to a massive extent for Iran actually to attempt a blockade. The question is also unclear as to whether Iran has to *successfully* maintain the blockade to satisfy the condition...

        "I'll quote a paragraph from the last Economist issue, since it's both illuminating and amusing:   \"Thailand could also do with a new constitution. The current one no longer works. The political system has broken and no one can see the way to devise a new one. The main opposition group, the Democrat Party, should contemplate a name change: to the \"anti-Democrats\", perhaps, or the catchier \"Born to Rule!\". It is boycotting next month&apos;s election not because it would be unfair (though it might be), but because it would lose. It has not won a general election for more than two decades. Its supporters in the south are outnumbered by those in the north and north-east of the country, who keep on voting in proxies for Thaksin Shinawatra, an exiled former prime minister. The forces that the Born to Rules represent, including much of Thailand&apos;s traditional elite, find this impossible to accept. They are openly campaigning for what amounts to dictatorship, though they do not call it that. Democracy has not worked for the Democrats.\"   The extreme and regional nature of Thailand's political divide makes this especially tricky.  The Democrats are mostly strong in the capital city and surrounding areas, and are favored by the business elite and national institutions like the military, so they have much more influence than their numerical popularity alone would suggest.  It's not at all inconceivable that the current crisis could lead to another coup and military junta like the one from 2006/2007.   My impression of the current government and Prime Minister is that they've pretty much reached their limit for the sorts of concessions they're willing to offer.  They're not going to simply pack up and go home, but the opposition is pretty much saying that they won't accept anything less.  If the opposition were to change its mind, I could definitely see the government agreeing to delay the current elections, but that would be a major concession from the opposition.  If that doesn't happen, I don't see any reason why the government would try to do anything but push forward with the current schedule, despite the boycott.  So I think Peter's got the right idea in thinking that the question is really just whether the opposition protests cause so much chaos that elections *can't* be held, or if there's a military coup.  Personally, I don't think the protests are going to be able to completely disrupt the elections, even if they make things difficult in Bangkok.  Most of my uncertainty, then, comes from not knowing how the military will react.  I lean against them taking over again, though, since I think they'll still be reluctant after the last time.  Still, I'm not going to forecast too high yet, since everything still seems up in the air.  I'll go with 65% as well.",

        "In this case, comparison classes can serve as a useful guide: How often has article 5 been invoked in the past? The only time so far was after the 9/11 attacks. Is it likely that an even of the same significance will occur within the next 8 months? It does not seem to be very likely.\n \n Counter to that, the situation in Ukraine might be seen as an indication that there is a higher likelihood of article 5 coming into play. However, Ukraine is not a NATO member and will not become one before the end of the forecasting period. There is the possibility of a confrontation between Russia and neighboring Baltic states, which are indeed NATO members, but at the moment that does not seem very likely.\n \n Another potential article 5 use case would be in Turkey, with either Syria or ISIS launching an attack. However, the fact that invoking article 5 is not an automatism but a political act and that military support by other NATO states can be rendered without the use of this specific mechanism, it again doesn't seem very likely at the moment.\n \n It has also been reported that at the latest NATO summit, article 5 has been expanded to now also encompass cyber attacks on member states.

There is about a 10% chance of passing on the infection in a hospital setting, a virtual certainty in an unprotected home setting.  \n \n So, to get a case into the EU, you need an asymptomatic infected person to enter and spend about a week in the EU. When the disease becomes symptomatic it also becomes infectious. Since it is transmitted through blood, sweat and tears and is relatively hardy you can get strange vectors, like leather taxi seats. (Ambulances are curiosities in West Africa; taxis are everywhere.) \n \n Until now Ebola has been a disease of poverty and poverty doesn't travel much. But as containment facilities are built, medical and paramedical personnel are at risk and they are much less likely to be living in poverty. So what are the odds that a recently trained paramedic will infect a relative who, while incubating, leaves on a business trip or visit to relatives in the EU and stays about a week?\n  \n Right now I'd say better than even odds. I'll start at 60%, but I'm going to play with the numbers a little and come back to this.",

        "For me the only doubt with this question is its very slim timeline. \n \n These are some of the events from the last week in Europe: \n \n - French police have detained five Chechens on suspicion of possessing explosives, with the country on high alert following attacks in Paris (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30894481).\n \n - A number of radical Dutch Muslims are on the run after the failed attack in Belgium and the terrorist attack in France. In the Hague alone 11 Muslims have fled. Four of them were arrested in Turkey. They were on their way to Syria (http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/01/19/radical-muslims-flee-netherlands-fearing-arrest/).\n \n - Police in Spain's north African enclave of Ceuta arrested four men on Saturday suspected of belonging to a militant Islamist network that may have been planning an attack in Spain, the interior ministry said (http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/24/us-spain-arrests-idUSKBN0KX0BU20150124)\n \n - Germany Arrests Two Suspected Jihadists With Alleged Islamic State Ties (http://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-arrests-two-suspected-jihadists-with-alleged-islamic-state-ties-1421919803). \n \n - Islamists killed in Belgian terror raids 'planned to massacre police in street' (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/16/belgium-terror-raid-jewish-schools-closed)\n \n - Arrests in Greece as Europe tightens security (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30869042)\n \n The real question is: Do you think that European security forces were able in one week to prevent all acts of radical Islamist terror planned to happen within the next 60 days? I don't. \n \n ISIS is pushing hard for all of its supporters to get out to the streets and conduct acts of violence. All is needed for this question to be resolved as positive, is one stupid person to \"lose it\", after watching ISIS propaganda videos. \n \n Will be giving higher chances for the occurrence to happen and downgrade it over the time.",

Aside from that I have trouble seeing Syria send rockets or mount an offensive towards Israel.  What exactly does Assad get out of attacking Israel? Its useful as a deterring threat before the fact, but what happens to Syria when the US commits a missile strike and then Syria attacks Israel in some way. Then Syria is likely attacked by Israel in a large way. Then Assad is left with a choice of simply taking the Israeli attack on the chin or escalating the conflict; at which point he is fighting two wars. Not to mention the fact that this puts even greater pressure on his allies. Its seems that the coalition wanting to strike Syria for use of chemical weapons would create enough consensus that would make it hard for Syrian allies to justify supporting Syria if they attacked Israel.

Given the political situation in North Korea right now, the only real way that this could happen is if there is a coup because the military inside North Korea decides that they no longer like Kim Jong-un's leadership. There are no indiciations that this might happen.  The second alternative is that continued nuclear testing by North Korea results in armed military intervention by outside forces, to remove Kim Jong-un from power.

Some options for emerging market to reduce the outward currency flow: raise interest rates, spend reserve dollars to prop up the currency or implement various types of currency controls.     Figures for the countries at issue: Since June 2013: Exchange rates have fallen (per 1$ ammounts, approx.): Arg 5.29 to 7.81, Brz 2.14 to 2.41,India 56.8 to 62.1, Indo 9,793 to 12,085 Turkey 1.89 to 2.93, S.Africa 10 to 11, Short term (3 mo)interest rates hsve risen in all 6 countries (approx.

        "The question refers to OPEC's \"oil output\" and not its \"production quota\". The latter is 30 million barrels per day, but actual output has been slightly more than this in the last few months. If OPEC announces that its members will strictly follow the quota, will that count as an agreement to cut output? I'm going to assume that any announced cut will refer to the quotas, not actual output. This has been their normal practice.\n \n Saudi Arabia has historically been the \"swing\" producer in OPEC, increasing or decreasing output to maintain prices. This time they are not expected to play their usual role.\n \n With the increase in US shale oil output, Saudi Arabia's exports to the US have been falling off and they need to find new markets, particularly in Asia, at a time when worldwide demand is reducing due to weakening economies in Europe and Asia in particular. The Saudis have signalled their intention to compete on market share by reducing prices by a dollar a barrel every month for the last four months. This has triggered a much bigger fall in the spot markets.\n \n Apart from economics, there is also a geopolitical angle. While the Saudis and UAE can tolerate $80-90 prices and more or less remain within their current budget, and have enough reserves to last out a longer price war, countries like Russia (and Iran along with others such as Venezuela) are much more dependent on oil income. It is in the interest of both the US and Saudi Arabia to pressure the Russian and Iranian economies right now (The collapse of the Soviet Union is often attributed, certainly within Russia, to the last time the Saudis pumped more oil and reduced prices to $10 per barrel).\n \n An even more interesting point that the Saudis must be considering is that at current prices, further expansion of shale oil in the US and other countries may not be feasible, which is another reason why they are likely to oppose any cut in production quotas.",
        "Outside of Crimea, there aren't any parts of Ukraine with enough population with a strong Russian identity that would simplify annexation or allow a referendum to be manipulated as easily as happened in Crimea. The most likely reason for further annexation would be to create a land corridor between Russian and Crimea. But Russia is already starting to build a large bridge at Kerch and it's easy to move people and goods by boat across the Kerch Strait. Boats and an eventual bridge would be much less of a problem than occupying a land corridor with a hostile population. Another possibility is occupying areas that could provide Crimea with electrical power and water, but again the hostile population problem makes other solutions look better. -- Putin is intentionally sending conflicting signals. There's no reliable way of reading his intentions. With the build up of forces along the Ukrainian border and the infiltration of Ukraine by Russian special ops forces, it's possible that he's planning another annexation. And as the example of Chechnya shows, he's perfectly capable of imposing his will on an unwilling population. But I'm betting that he doesn't think it's worth problems it would create if he did it with part of Ukraine.",
        "I agree with moonvilleman's analysis regarding timeline of previous testing, etc.  While there is still just over three months until this question closes, it has only been a year and half since North Korea's last nuclear test.  Past precedent seems to indicate they can't move that fast; most probably because of the slow pace required to maintain secrecy in building facilities and prepping prior to the test, not to mention the difficulty in securing materials due to sanctions, etc.  One interesting note is that all three of North Korea's previous nuclear tests were conducted after UN sanctions for conducting separate ballistic missile test were imposed.  In some senses this question may dovetail with the long-range missile test question in that respect.  Lastly, there is also ambiguity surrounding whether the last test was even successful given that no radioactive isotopes were recorded (though a thoroughly well built and concealed facility could prevent that).  Will they test again, most probably; will it be before the new year, very doubtful.",

Surprisingly, NK issues don't factor as much as you would expect them to in a domestic election.

This gives a somewhat freer hand to the Korean executive to do what they feel like needs to be done with regards to NK.

These payments may well have been commercially acceptable, but he didn't disclose them.

        "Comparison classes: The appropriate comparison class are other cases of sanctions through SWIFT. So far there has been only one case, the sanctions against Iran. SWIFT initially was unwilling to implement international sanctions but eventually did disconnect Iranian banks. There have been campaigns to disconnect Israeli banks, but they were not backed by international sanctions and consequently failed. \n \n Players, norms, protocols: SWIFT is technically governed by its board of directors, representing its member banks. Within that board, it is not entirely clear how decisions are made. Using the comparison case of the Iran sanctions and looking at the NSA monitoring of SWIFT activities, it appears that the US government (and probably other governments) has significant indirect influence on decisions. The key to influencing SWIFT's actions is probably unity among major governments in Europe and the US. This unity currently is not in place with regard to sanctions: Kicking Russia out of SWIFT is a very major step and would lead to retaliation from Russia (gas exports would be one likely area). Currently major European governments are not willing to risk that backlash, as they are more economically dependent on trade with Russia than the US. Therefore, it seems likely that the situation in Ukraine would have to deteriorate more before a consensus in Europe could be reached and SWIFT sanctions would be implemented. Required then is an analysis of the Ukraine conflict over the next couple of months. The cease-fire theoretically in place doesn't seem to have led to a significant decrease in tension for now, but it is difficult to predict how the conflict is going to further develop.

On the other hand, there are very likely Russian troops in Ukraine already.  Any incident could trigger war or a confrontation leading to death, making prediction difficult.  I am leaning slightly against due to the risk of severe sanctions against particular sector of the Russian economy.  The risk of invasion will decrease if the humanitarian aid crisis can be resolved and if Ukraine offers safe passage out of the country for insurgents if they are about to lose.",

Some key things to note:\n \n -Putin's rhetoric lends one to perceive it is a Russian priority to be victorious in the Ukraine crisis; annexation seems to be implied.\n -However, the annexation is focused on Crimea only, and with a slew of sanctions and threats from other actors, it is not in Russia's interest to officially declare any additional annexation.\n -That's not to say there won't be rumors of unofficial occupation of other areas, especially as covert/unmarked personnel are found in the country. Based upon Putin's past (fixated and obsessive) behavior on Ukraine, under-the-radar operations may continue. \n \n Since this question limits to only official declaration, I'd say it seems highly unlikely at this point. I will continue to update.",

For a \"yes\" resolution, an attack must be successfully implemented on Israeli ground. Bombings and suicide attacks carried out on the ground will count toward a \"yes\" resolution, but surface-to-air attacks (e.g., rockets hitting an Israeli aircraft) will not count.  And .Israeli territory refers to any land that lies within Israel's official borders, including the occupied territories and Israeli settlements (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders_of_Israel ), as well as Israeli embassies abroad.

At present, I don't see any linkage at all, and so I'm not offering a different forecast between the questions.  I am optimistic that a SOFA will be signed, unlike Iraq.  I think the Afghan government is much more eager to retain direct American military assistance than Iraq was, despite the PR costs of it, and despite how much I think they actually *need* it.  When it comes down to it, I think they will bite the bullet and grant US soldiers immunity from prosecution, possibly with some other minor practical concession (like more money) from the US or just some meaningless rhetorical endorsement of Afghan law.  If the question was open all the way through 2015, I think I'd peg the probability around 70%.  Since it's only asking whether the agreement will be signed before January 2014, however, I'm leaning towards less than 50%.  This is definitely the sort of negotiation I think could come down to the wire, similar to the way Iraq did (before failing).  I'm not aware of any deadlines which would make it necessary to find a deal before 2014, other than the danger of getting both sides backed into a diplomatic corner from which they can't escape the longer negotiations get dragged out and the more heated they become.

        "DPRK wanted Japan to lift the ban on their ferry entering Japanese ports as a condition of releasing a report on North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens. [1] But Japan has resisted doing that: \"Japan, however, has told North Korea that it is too early to agree to lift the ban on the Mangyongbong-92 after merely receiving the first report.\" [2] It seems likely that Japan would ask for more concessions in return for lifting the ban - not merely accepting DPRK's report.\n \n More recently, it has emerged that Japan rejected the report in question. [3] The Japanese govt. put some pressure on DPRK leading up to the report's release, but I'm not sensing much urgency on either side to strike a deal. [4] The last time there were negotiations on this issue, they eventually fell through, though not before DPRK admitted to abducting some people and allowed some of them to return. [5] The North Korean ferry has taken to the seas again, which one might think would indicate DPRK's optimism that it will be allowed to visit Japan, but this alone will have no effect on the Japanese government's willingness to lift the ban. DPRK has instead been using the ferry for other stuff, like using it to bring their athletes to the Asia Games.\n \n DPRK wants 'humanitarian aid' (mainly food shipments?) from Japan in addition to allowing the ferry to visit Japan, but it seems they don't want it badly enough to accede to Japan's demands just yet. Japan wants an admission from DPRK that they abducted more than the small number of Japanese citizens that they already admit to have abducted.\n \n Although relations between the two countries have shown signs of thawing in recent months, there are still no formal diplomatic ties between the two. Despite an earlier report on the possibility of Japan PM Abe meeting with KJU, it will almost certainly not happen without there being some progress on the abduction issue. There is also a good chance that DPRK will conduct another long-range missile test within this time frame (presumably fired into the Sea of Japan or over Japan), which would worsen relations between the two and perhaps end talks on the abduction issue. After all, it was DPRK's 2006 missile test that made Japan impose the ban in the first place. This is the main source of uncertainty that comes to mind. What about the Japanese using a stick (sanctions) rather than a carrot (aid, concessions)? I don't think the current level of protest from Japanese groups representing the abductees or other nongovernmental groups will be sufficient to push the Japanese govt. to introduce new sanctions that might pressure DPRK to move forward on this, but I'm not sure.\n \n Overall, I think this is unlikely, especially considering that DPRK's most recent adbuctee report was rejected. Will set an alert for news relating to North Korean abduction of Japanese, since this is the key issue that will determine whether Japan lifts the ferry ban. In the absence of any positive news, will reduce my prediction over time as the deadline approaches. I will of course temper my pessimism in light of positive developments.\n \n [1] http://thediplomat.com/2014/09/pyongyangs-abductee-report-still-not-ready/\n [2] http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/140828/n-korea-may-delay-1st-abduction-probe-report-late-sept\n [3] http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/09/21/national/politics-diplomacy/rejected-japan-refuses-accept-north-koreas-new-report-abductees-citing-lack-fresh-info/\n [4] http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/japan-north-korea-abductions-report-25559586\n [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_abductions_of_Japanese_citizens#Talks_between_North_Korea_and_Japan_in_2002_and_aftermath",

In fact, projections do not go much beyond a month, but they are daunting.  Furthermore, ebola is a particularly dangerous variety of hemorrhagic fever given that the incubation period (~21 days) is much longer than it is for other related diseases such as Marburg.  Combine the long incubation period with the speed of modern travel, then it appears that an outbreak in the developed world is a near certainty.

This might happen after the ISIL thing is a distant memory, but seems very unlikely while there is still such a group at their doorstep.\n \n Doubt for this comes from: \n - This really is an excellent time for them to stake their claim that since they're protecting themselves anyway and seem to be the only force in Iraq capable of repelling ISIL, they don't need Baghdad and they do need to be able to make their own deals. \n - Turkey may actually endorse a Kurdish state if it didn't incur onto Turkish territory and there will never be a better time to make that deal.",

        "I do not think it is likely that she will vacate the office of the President before 1 June this year, but I'll put it at 40% for now because of the huge possibility for wildcards in this rather unorthodox and crazy situation. \n \n President Kirchner is currently dealing with unofficial rumors about her involvement in covering up the bombing of a Jewish community building in 1994. Alberto Nisman,a federal prosecutor, was prepared to speak before their congress and present evidence to prove these rumors true, but was found dead in his hotel room only one day before he was set to testify. Now, rumors are flying and protests being held accusing Kirchner from being involved in this murder as well. \n \n Despite the volatile situation in the country, the main reason I do not think she will vacate office is simply that this is not a new situation. The bombing/murder situation may be, but Kirchner's erratic behavior is not. This Time article was published way back in 2008, and details her poll numbers \"plummeting\" only six months into her administration due to her decisions and governing methods:\n http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1811257,00.html\n \n Her presidential term is up in October, and she cannot run again. Therefore, I really don't think she will voluntarily vacate her office before 1 June. I also don't think she will forcibly be removed by anyone, because frankly, if she truly did have something to do with the federal prosecutor's death, there is going to be no one brave enough to force her to vacate. \n \n In all honesty, this may a completely crazy point, but I truly believe that the wildcard here would be her vacating her office due to her death. That is how pretty much every other south and central American leaders vacated their office before their terms were up. This region does not have a track record of removing leaders by conventional means, and illness or old age usually do that job themselves.

        "This is a toughie, irreducible-uncertainty-wise, because like the Yasukuni shrine question from last year, the whole thing can be tipped by a single individual (Putin) with very little warning right up until the last day of the question.\n \n Clearly, the Russian-backed insurgents are on their way out without a massive intervention from Moscow.  Donetsk and Luhansk are cut off from Russia and the remaining insurgent-held territory.  The rebel leadership has hemorrhaged its once-dominant Russian cadre (including Igor Strelkov) to the point where the deputy defense minister of the insurgents in Donetsk is a science-fiction novel author (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/europe/plenty-of-room-at-the-top-of-ukraines-fading-rebellion.html).  The following article cites speculation that the white Russian aid trucks, many of which are empty, may be parked in front of rebel-held structures to act as shields (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/world/europe/idled-russian-aid-convoy-gets-back-on-the-road-to-ukraine.html)\n \n The 20,000 Russian troops on the Ukrainian border will serve to back up Putin's negotiators in Berlin if he doesn't get what he wants.  I believe that Putin is willing to invade if he has to, but he'd rather exhaust his covert and diplomatic options for compelling Ukraine to federalize first.  The above articles suggest that the 'Ukrainianization' of the insurgent leadership is a first step in achieving a negotiated settlement.\n \n So in summary, I do put a moderate prediction of 3 deaths happening in the next six weeks involving uniformed Russian forces, but much of that prediction is based on the risk of clashes short of invasion, such as a cross-border artillery strike or the shooting down of a Ukrainian aircraft that Russia would claim violated its territory.\n \n \n ",

The US public has not demonstrated the opposition to air or drone strikes, probably because they are seen as limited engagements and low risk to loss of US lives.\n \n There are also possibilities that other Middle East countries taking active steps to degrade ISIS inside of Syria.

I'll make a wild guess that the chance of it being imported to any other EU country is 5%.  Combined that means the chance of it being imported to the EU (ignoring all other EU countries!) was 41% = 1 - (1-.25)*(1-.10)*(1-.05)*(1-.03)*(1-.05).\n \n What are the chances an imported infection will not be confirmed to have started in West Africa even though it had and what are the chances any case will be transmitted within the EU (the question's resolution criteria)?  Note that if a case is imported from a non-West African country, it would count.  I'm going to be conservative and make a wild guess of 10%, so the chance of a qualifying case by 9/21 might be 4.1% = .41*.10.\n \n Do any of you have or can find information about what the chance of it spreading is so I can improve my 10% guess?\n \n If there's a 4.1% chance per month and a little over 8 months to go, the chance is 72% = (1-0.041)**8.\n \n How might things change?  What more will the world do to stop the outbreak?  Will travel from infected regions to Africa be cut further?  Will Europe start screening arriving people more?  What?\n \n I should reduce the 72% because I'd guess things will get worse slower than the article projected for September due to international fears, but I kind'a think my 10% is low, so I'll stick with 72% as my baseline and use the Playground to bump it.",

According to the article above this will worsen in 2015:\n \n \n \"From the UBS China trip: Talking with iron ore traders, the expectation is for a modest rally in the iron ore price before year end on restocking post the APEC meeting and ahead of the Chinese winter and Australia's wet season. But it is expected to be modest, perhaps a lift of 3-5 days at the most. Iron ore price seen lower again in 2015 than in 2014 with a print under US$60/dmt cfr likely as property again seen weak in 2015.\"\n \n Other reports in the same article suggest that iron ore spot will fall to $50.\n \n The slide in spot prices is in many ways parallel to the slide in crude oil.  \n \n http://online.wsj.com/articles/chinas-push-for-clear-skies-hits-iron-ore-market-1415673723\n \n The slowing economy in China and the most recent shutdown of chinese factories to clean up the air for the APEC meetings has led to significant oversupply and depressed demand of ore.   \n \n While iron ore producers do not have a cartel similar to OPEC there are major players and minor players.  In this case, BHP and Rio Tinto are increasing their production of iron ore driving the price down in light of reduced demand with the intent of capturing market share as more expensive operators (China's iron ore mining operations notably) are forced to shut down.  \n \n BHP and Rio Tinto have strong balance sheets and lower production costs and can sustain lower prices for an extended period of time (think Saudi Arabia in the oil comparison).  This appears to be a strategy that will effectively drive small players out of the market while demand for iron ore is weak and grab market share for the bigger more cost effective players.  \n \n Based upon the cited news reports and others, it appears that the spot price or iron ore will fall below $71 per ton and much lower.  No one expects a surge of demand based on a rapid turnaround of the economies of China or Europe (rapid meaning the next six weeks).  Question 1464 appears to hinge on how rapidly the fall will occur. \n \n In this regard spot prices have fallen 44% but the rate of the continuing fall may moderate.  In fact, once the APEC meeting overhang of factory shutdowns is over, there may be a slight bounce in prices as noted in the article above.  \n \n Based on these factors, I think the likelihood of spot prices below $71 per ton is less likely than 50/50 over the next six weeks.  Once there is some distance from the end of the APEC meetings, I'll re-evaluate. This question is also similar to the question about the upward or downward movement of the reminbi.  While there are indicators, the underlying factors as well as market speculation that effect the outcomes simply need close monitoring.  For better or worse, I think the likelihood is 40% over the short term.  \n \n Here are some additional references:\n \n http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/grim-day-for-asx-as-iron-ore-miners-crash-20141112-11l901.html \n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/11/us-iron-ore-home-idUSKCN0IU0X120141111 \n http://www.macrobusiness.com.au/category/iron-ore-price/ \n http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-10/anz-declares-the-party-s-over-for-iron-ore-as-price-outlook-cut.html \n \n \n \n ",

But Saudi officials have telegraphed a different message in private meetings with oil market investors and analysts recently: the kingdom, OPEC's largest producer, is ready to accept oil prices below $90 per barrel, and perhaps down to $80, for as long as a year or two, according to people who have been briefed on the recent conversations.\" (Emphasis added.)\n \n Another article stated:\n \n \"On Sunday, Ali al-Omair, oil minister of Saudi Arabia's core Gulf ally Kuwait, appeared to be the first to articulate the emerging view of OPEC's most influential member, saying output cuts would do little to prop up prices in the face of rising production from Russia and the United States.\n \n 'I don't think today there is a chance that (OPEC) countries would reduce their production,' state news agency KUNA quoted him as saying.\n \n Omair said that prices should stop falling at around $76 to $77 a barrel, citing production costs in places such as the United States, where a shale oil boom has unexpectedly reversed dwindling output and pushed production to its highest level since the 1980s.\"\n \n There are several factors at play here:\n \n 1.  The projected demand for oil has dropped considerably (22%) as noted in http://online.wsj.com/articles/iea-cuts-its-2014-oil-demand-growth-forecast-to-its-weakest-in-five-years-1413274259.  A slowdown in China and Europe are reducing demand.\n \n 2.  The supply of oil is far in excess of demand in great part due to the tremendous growth of oil production in the U.S. market via fracking.  At the present time U.S. oil production is exceeding the ability to use or store oil.\n \n 3.  The effect of sanctions on Russia have signficantly degraded its economy and Russia has become dependent on oil revenue to sustain itself.  Maintaining sales is leading to a price war to ensure Russian oil is fully purchased in the open market.\n \n 4.  OPEC nations have the staying power to manage a sustained reduction in the oil price to shake out \"weaker\" players in the market.  If oil continues to drop, it may create revenue shortfall in OPEC but those producers who have higher production costs (which may include U.S. frackers\" may be forced to curtail their expansion.  This, in fact, may be a strategy employed by OPEC to dissuade growth in U.S. oil production.\n \n 5.  The Saudis, Kuwaitis and Iranis all have pledged to stay the course without production cuts.  Iran's economy has suffered for years due to sanctions incluing those on oil.  It is unlikely that they would have interest in reducing production with the hope of increasing the price.  Until and unless there was an enforceable agreement among all OPEC nations to reduce production (historically even after pledging to do so most member nations did not abide by pledges) there would seem to be little interest in attempting this strategy.  Even Libya which is still fraught with political upheaval has re-entered the oil market with substantial sales.  Even with a solid pledge, it is very risky to stage a production cut in the midst of an oil glut.  \n \n Even if oil prices drop further, the ability to sustain loses between now and November 27 (just about a month away) would not require OPEC to change its position.  The market may self-heal (though unlikely) or further reductions may knock out competition. Their espoused policy of no production cuts will take some time to evaluate.\n \n For all of these reasons, I think the likelihood of OPEC cuts before Nov 27 is quite low and will begin with a probability of 15% while following the course of the market and politics closely.  \n ",

        "In line with other forecasts, Kirchner will hang on until June. There are two realistic possibilities for Kirchner vacating office - resignation or impeachment/arrest - neither of which I assess to be high.\n \n First, for an arrest/conviction to occur, according to Argentine law, \"no judge can convict the president, the vice president, or cabinet ministers without an impeachment.\" Since Kirchner's Partido Justicialista has a parliamentary majority in both houses, so long as party discipline is maintained, there is no threat of this occurring. Even with small scale rebellion amongst party members, it would require a large scale desertion to swing the tide in favor of the opposition. The historically clientist networks established through the Peronist party legacy should be sufficient to maintain discipline (and given Kircher's ability to hold on in the face of wide scale popular unhappiness over the past 10 years, I think a status quo argument speaks strongly in favor of her continuing ability to do so). \n \n http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/Warrant-for-Argentine-President-Cristina-Fernandez-de-Kirchner-Reportedly-Found-in-Garbage-of-Dead-Prosecutor-Alberto-Nisman/385136/\n \n http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/13/did-argentina-s-president-order-an-assassination.html\n \n Second, while she is barred from running for re-election in 2015, she could plausibly run again in 2019.

        "I'm not a big fan of technical analysis of stock markets, but GJP asks us to look at comparison classes, so I started off by looking at price volatility on TOPIX from January 2012 to the present.  TOPIX closed at 1286 today, according to Bloomberg, so this question is asking how likely an 80-point drop is in the next 2+ months.  (For the sake of simplicity, I'll call this a quarter.) Since 2012, TOPIX suffered an 80-point drop in 4 quarters and no such drop in 6. Assuming the global and regional macroeconomic environment stays constant (i.e., modest improvement) show, which I think is likely, and assuming no political crisis with China or North Korea, that indicates a 40% chance it will close below 1200 during the period in question.\n \n Now, as I noted above, I dislike technical analysis.

My own feeling is that the US mini-correction of late July is over, and that fundamentals are reasonably strong, so I am bullish on the next two months.

        "During August, sea ice extent declines more slowly as the sun starts to set in the Arctic and the sea ice minimum approaches. Thus, the window is closing on potential ice loss through the remaining summer. A simple way to estimate how much ice loss may occur during the rest of the summer is to extrapolate daily ice loss, using rates of ice loss from previous years. The approach provides a reasonable bracket on possible scenarios through September. Using the 1980 rate of ice loss yields the highest potential minimum this year, because the end of summer rate of ice loss in 1980 was very slow. The lowest potential minimum is estimated using the 2012 rate of ice loss, as there was rapid ice loss in 2012. No scenario suggests a minimum near the record low year of 2012. Most likely this year's minimum will be between 5.0 and 5.5 million square kilometers (1.9 and 2.1 million square miles). This number will be close to the 2013 level, but looks on track to *not* be less than 4.8 million square kilometers.",

        "This question is largely best rephrased as, \"will India sign the TFA\"? So to begin with, I will say that if India signs, there's a 95% chance the remaining objectors (Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, etc. will sign).  Note also that the TFA could de facto be ratified as a plurilateral agreement (i.e., between many, but not all, WTO members) without India's support.\n \n India's objections center on food security, which is a hot-button issue in India. Other countries will undoubtedly place a significant amount of pressure on India to sign. Narendra Modi is perceived to be an economic liberalizer and built his reputation on attracting FDI to Gujarat. However, even liberalizers need to pick their battles, and the agriculture lobby is strong in many, many places (e.g., the US, Japan, EU), and that is not necessarily the first lobby he would want to take on. Other areas of liberalization are lower-hanging fruit.  \n \n The Hufbauer interview (http://www.dw.de/indias-resistance-to-key-trade-agreement-deals-major-blow-to-wto/a-17825540) does a good job of framing these issues.  It does suggest several concessions that might make the agriculture issue tolerable to India.  Several days ago, however, India also declined to sign the Asean Services and Investment Agreement. This suggests that Modi is signalling he won't agree to this compromise soon.\n \n Finally, there is the lingering failure to conclude the Doha ROund.\n \n So, I would put the chance of ratification at 20% if there is no change in WTO food subsidy rules. I do think that if the WTO food subsidy rules get reformed - such that the cap gets lifted above 10% of total grain production, or such that reference prices get calculated according to a more recent year than 1986 -- the chances increase greatly. Modi told Nick Clegg (http://www.livemint.com/Politics/P4daJEnG5ORnWQDuj4MYAM/Food-security-should-not-be-sole-reason-for-stopping-WTO-dea.html) that India's sole concern was the food subsidy regime.",

The US explicitly supports Japan and India, but doesn't really want Brazil to have a veto in the Council, and doesn't really seem excited about Germany.  China, on the other hand, is vehemently opposed to Japanese membership, and has said that it would only support India getting a permanent seat if India drops its joint campaign with Japan.  Russia supports Brazil, and possibly India though I haven't seen mention of that, but probably wants to give up as little influence as possible.

        "Usually, exchange rates are utterly unpredictable, but this one seems quite straightforward. The ruble has never traded above 38, but in the last year it has fallen from little over 30 to 37.5, which is where it trades today. The reason, clearly, is the Ukraine crisis, which means that the question can be translated into: Will Putin continue to escalate, or is the conflict at least going to be managed (either frozen or deescalated)? \n \n As I see it, we're again at a tipping point in this whole thing, with concrete talk about a cease-fire on the one hand, and increased sanctions on the other. Judging from what has happened so far, it has been better to bet on increased escalation. Putin has been quite consistent in continuing to push Ukraine and Russia towards ruin, and there are now many forces (not least the rebels) that constrain him from suddenly changing course. So I'd argue that we have a mild leaning towards Yes, but follow the news closely in the next few days and adjust accordingly.",

More recent polling suggests Rousseff is running in the 36-39% range, a plurality, but far less than the absolute majority she will need to avoid a runoff. Neves has been running in the low 20% range. After Eduardo Campos died in a plane crash, his running mate and replacement saw a huge spike in the polls to 21%. This is probably just an effect of the coverage of the crash, but the jump for the PSB doesn't correspond with any decline in support for the PT or PSDB, so it might actually show a consolidation of 3rd party supporters around a single candidate.

The talks in Beijing this week were initially planned for two days, but were extended to a third day and wrapped up on Friday.   The two sides, which don't have diplomatic relations, agreed to coordinate so that \"issues of interest\" to both could be addressed at future talks in Beijing, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Masaru Sato said...   ...Discussions between Tokyo and Pyongyang have been frozen since August 2008 because of animosity over past frictions, the kidnappings and disputes over the North's nuclear program.   South Korean analysts have said North Korea is using the talks to improve ties with Japan because it urgently needs economic help, and probably wants both investments and compensation for Tokyo's colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula in 1910-1945.   The meetings were \"frank\" and \"sincere,\" Sato said.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120831/as-japan-nkorea/",

        "Turkey has invaded neighboring countries - notably Iraq - several times over the last decade.  This alone nudges me away from a firm \"No\" response.  I am evaluating this at 60% \"Yes\" at the present.  My reasoning is below.  1. As Sirfrappa out, there is much uncertainty about this question.  In this respect, there's symmetry between this and the earlier question about a foreign force firing into Syria.  This uncertainty keeps me from going decisively in one direction or another.   2. Despite this uncertainty, there is precedent for Turkey invading its neighbors, though in general the Turks have been provoked much more frequently than they have invaded.  In each one of the cases where Turkey did invade, the invasions were in response to cross-border  provocations, which in the case of Syria have occurred several times over the last several weeks.  In this respect, conditions are ripe for continued Turkish responses.  3. When the Turks moved, it was en masse.  The last incursion into Iraq reportedly number between 3,000 to 10,000 soldiers, depending on the report. This indicates to me the question isn't so much about the issue of 'a significant military forces' as it is whether or not Turkey will invade over the next six weeks (for what it's worth, I will bet - 90% certain - that Turkey already has special operations forces operating inside Syria to evaluate the environment and pull together targeting data).  4. One thing that elevates the likelihood a bit is that Turkey recently initiated counterbattery fires into Syria and detained a Russian air craft reportedly smuggling weapons into Syria.  I read these as careful escalations designed to draw out international responses.  Overall, the responses have been largely muted.  I believe the absence of strong responses will embolden the Turkish leadership to conduct a ground raid on Syrian positions to retaliate for a provocation.  5. One problem with updating this forecast is that if the Turks react, it will be in response to an Syrian provocation, and the response will be relatively quick - hours or a day or two.  The Turkish leadership has moved well past crisis management with Syria and they likely have been working through the contingency operations for several months now.  The troops are in position, the planning is ongoing if not completed, and the intelligence to support punitive raids or other operations is being gathered.    ",

The sources I've seen suggest SoL will do well:  \"First, Maliki is likely to win a plurality of seats in the next parliament, and he might win a very big plurality.  Following the departure of the last U.S. troops in 2011, Maliki&apos;s moves against various Sunni leaders have frightened an already wary Sunni Arab community.  In turn, they have, re-embraced various terrorist/insurgent groups such as al-Qa&apos;ida (AQ), the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the 1920 Revolution Brigade, Jaysh al-Islam, Ansar al-Sunnah, etc.  The terrorist attacks perpetrated by these groups have only inflamed Shi&apos;a sentiment against the Sunnis, pushing the government to crack down harder on the Sunnis in a vicious cycle.   Maliki has benefitted from this situation simply by being the incumbent and because his Shi&apos;a rivals have allied themselves with the main Sunni political parties, who cannot denounce the violence for fear of alienating their constituency.  As a result, when the worst violence began in western Iraq in January and February, Maliki&apos;s two main Shi&apos;a rivals-ISCI and the Sadrists-shilly-shallied because of their alliance with the mainstream Sunni leaders.  This discredited both in the eyes of many Shi&apos;a, who have been incensed by the Sunni terror attacks on their community and want \"the government\" to crack down as hard as possible.  Although Maliki has so far refrained from moving into Fallujah and Ramadi, he has nevertheless been the beneficiary of this Shi&apos;a outrage because he at least talks tough about extirpating the Sunni terrorists.   In addition, Muqtada al-Sadr&apos;s bizarre and unexpected decision to disband his political party and withdraw from politics has further benefitted Maliki.

        "Bloomberg quotes Edward Chow, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington, as saying that Saudi Arabia is effectively the only country in a position to increase or decrease production at will. Further reporting indicates that Saudi Arabia needs Brent Crude (a benchmark oil price) to be $83.60 a barrel to balance its budget, but that SA has run deficits in the past to preserve its market share/dominance.\n \n Other players involved who could suffer as a result of lower oil prices include Iran and Russia, which could suggest (especially in the case of Iran) that OPEC nations would be fine with more problems for those countries. However, Iran is also reported to have said they will not ask for OPEC to reduce output. The wildcard is Venezuela which has called for an emergency meeting of OPEC ahead of Nov 27. No indication this will happen though.\n \n Recent news reporting is explicit that OPEC nations say they will not reduce output in the near future. Further, the price drop, which is in part due to increased production in the US of shale gas, could make additional shale development too expensive to continue, thereby reducing output and bringing prices back up. This is based on my understanding that shale drilling is more expensive than the typical form of oil extraction, and that output from shale wells drops off precipitously after an initial high output, requiring new wells to be drilled regularly to maintain overall output levels.\n \n My initial forecast will favor output not being cut and I will adjust over time as the deadline approaches, while also monitoring benchmark oil prices.",
        "Caveat: The following not authoritative, just a quick Google compilation.   Tarawneh was appointed by the king in April to replace the previous PM who wasn't moving fast enough on governmental reforms.  From AFP 6/19:  The king is pushing to hold crucial early elections before the end of 2012 as Jordanians have held relatively small but persistent Arab Spring-inspired demonstrations almost every week since last year to demand sweeping reforms.  The PM has been effective, but the limited reforms requested by the king don't satisfy the protesters, who want the PM to step down because rather than directly representing the people, he represents the king.  The king has long been dedicated to defusing the explosive potential of the protests, mainly through a process of gradual reform, which he is now forced to speed up due to various economic and social pressures, including the inundation of Jordan by first Palestinian and now Syrian refugees.  I guess it would be fair to call the king a benevolent despot.  There's no likelihood of his being dethroned in the timeframe, and the PM is effectively serving at his pleasure, so the PM is likely to stay on through the elections expected late in the year, protesters' calls for his resignation notwithstanding.

        "The CDC's announcement today that an individual in Dallas was diagnosed with Ebola causes me to give this a fairly high chance of occurring. While it does not directly increase the chance of a case in Europe, it does demonstrate the deficiencies of disease surveillance and the impact of porous borders globally. Furthermore, the multiday incubation period would make it just as easy for an infected individual to board a plane to Europe as it was to fly to the US. The large number of European aid workers, such as those involved with MSF, who are currently on-the-ground, as well as significant trade links, results in a high risk that at least one confirmed case of Ebola will emerge in the next eight months. The only \"wildcard\" which might avoid this outcome is a massive global response complete with total travel bans and intrusive disease monitoring which I see no chance of occurring unless the disease becomes globally rampant, and even by that time, at least one European case would probably occur. \n \n Unless there is a significant shift in the response to the epidemic, I don't forsee myself adjusting my prediction downward until sometime easly next year.

        "As an avid listener of NPR on my daily commute, I recalled a piece on air regarding IS / ISIS / ISIL, \"What's in a Name?\". Only recalling portions of the  news piece, I first thought of going back and looking at the transliteration of the organization name and its potential meaning. \n \n Transliteration of the ISIS/ISIL name is \"al-Dawlah al-Islamiyah fi al-'Iraq wa-al-Sham\". The portion we will be scrutinizing is al-Sham. Translated, al-Sham means either Levant or Greater Syria depending on the translation. Look up al-Sham on Wikiperdia and it redirects to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_(region). The area referenced does include portions of Jordan, one of the five countries named in the question. \n \n Second, we must look at maps of control and operations by ISIS. The maps referenced below from the nytimes.com give great information regarding areas under the influence of ISIS, but it is difficult to see the roads on the map. The second listing from aljazeera.net has much better clarity for major roads through the countries and show the areas of conflict. \n \n By superimposing the areas together, it is clear that ISIS aims to control the main arteries for transportation throughout the countries, which also would coincide with population centers and key areas. Their strategy is to link villages together by moving down these major roads and take control however necessary.\n \n A general map of the Middle East shows that Saudia Arabia and Jordan are both countries that share borders with Iraq. Jordan also borders Syria. By looking at the sites of conflict, it seems that the roads to Saudi Arabia seem to be safe for the time being. The major roads from Iraq to Jordan are a different story.\n \n By looking at the maps, we see that ISIS has control of Ar Rutbah (Rutba) in the Al Anbar province of Iraq, which is about 70 miles (110 km) from the border with Jordan. The status of the Tarbil border crossing with Jordan seems to remain in an unknown status. It would seem to indicate that either Sunni tribesmen control it, or it is controlled by ISIS with a low profile. \n \n Furthermore, we have seen threats from ISIS to Jordan and King Abdullah II. However, would this indicate an imminent threat? Yes, and no. \n \n After Iraq and Syria, ISIS would certainly target Lebanon and Jordan as the next areas for expansion. While ISIS is categorized as a bunch of terrorists, they are much different from other groups we have seen before. Their goal is to establish a new caliphate, which they have technically declared already, and building their own state. What constitutes a state? Would a state be loosely defined as people, territory, resources, finance, and a government? ISIS has all of the above. \n \n Generally speaking, the ISIS support base is built upon Sunni Muslims. The areas of fighting? Against Shia and Kurdish Muslims, and any other secular faction in their path. As a result, ISIS will tend to cater to their base of support in the Sunni communities and attempt to dominate in order to build their state. From a religious perspective, Jordan is roughly 92% Muslim with the vast majority Sunni. \n \n While unrest in Jordan would really send shockwaves through the Middle East and rattle Israel, its neighbor, ISIS may not be prepared to open that front just yet. Most likely, they will continue to press their advantages in Iraq to topple the weak government, and consolidate its forces with their march west to finish off Syria.\n \n In summary, would ISIS mount a large scale attack on Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, or the United Arab Emirates before 1 February 2015? Probably not. Would elements potentially viewed as aligned with ISIS or affiliates stir up trouble in any one of these countries? Probably, yes. However, it is imperative to watch what happens closely in the area, as well as reactions from the US and Israel should ISIS continue to push further west.\n \n \n Map Resources:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?_r=0\n \n http://webapps.aljazeera.net/aje/custom/2014/ISILpaththruiraq/index.html\n \n \n Other references:\n \n http://icsr.info/2013/12/icsr-insight-11000-foreign-fighters-syria-steep-rise-among-western-europeans/\n \n http://www.mintpressnews.com/the-key-to-stop-isis-from-spreading-to-jordan-rests-in-iraq/196095/",

        "Base Rate:  Regarding rockets, this is not particularly a question about attacks, it is a question of lethality. The definition of \"significant attack\" is three Israeli deaths.  There have been 4800 rockets launched since 2001, and 13 deaths resulting from the hits. That sets base rocket lethality at 0.3%. So the question really becomes \"Will the Palestinians launch more than 900 rockets before 5/10/14?\" or some other avenue of attack. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel.   Of course, there is always the chance of a unlucky shot, or an attack that does not involve rockets.

Elections held after his death resulted in Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian, winning, which angered Muslims who thought that a Muslim should have been chosen to (at least) finish out Yar'Adua's term.\n \n President Jonathan's term has been plagued by: typical Nigerian oil-based corruption; increase in piracy in the Gulf of Guinea (also largely oil-based); the rise of Boko Haram; among others.\n \n Now that Jonathan is planning to run *again*, northern Muslims are even more upset, and if he wins, the feeling that the Nigerian state has abandoned them is inevitable. This could lead northerners to deny the legitimacy of the Abuja government altogether (as Boko Haram already has).\n \n So as I mentioned, this question can be resolved YES either a) by his losing the election or b) by him winning but subsequently vacating.\n \n A. Will he win the election?\n \n This seems likely, based on the heavy advantage incumbents have (even more than in the US):\n \"The president still appears to be in a strong position, partly because there is no clear alternative, but also because Nigerian elections tend to be fought more on vast patronage than on policy, which gives an encumbent in this oil-rich state an advantage.\"\n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/29/us-nigeria-election-idUSKBN0II1G720141029\n \n I'll track his chances as elections draw near, but right now I'll give him a 90% chance of winning.\n \n B. Assuming he wins, will he vacate?\n \n If he wins, he will definitely lose legitimacy, but assuming the election violence and fraud can be kept to a minimum (at least as far as can be determined) so that international pressure is kept at bay, he will probably retain support from the more populous south, which contains both Nigeria's oil and the supporters benefiting from the regime's oil-based patronage.\n \n What would have to happen for him to vacate after winning? Probably one or more of the following: widespread, publicized election fraud; major unrest throughout the north, not just in the northeast where Boko Haram operates; international pressure strong enough to convince Jonathan or (more likely) the people whose support he buys with oil money that he needs to go.\n \n Assuming he wins the election, I'll go with a 20% chance that events will precipitate him leaving office. This means I think he's more likely to leave by force (20%) than by losing the election (10%).\n \n So let me see if my math works here. There are three possible outcomes:\n a) He loses the election (10%)\n b) He wins the election but is forced out (20% of the remaining 90% = 18%)\n c) He wins the election and stays through June 10 (80% of the remaining 90% = 72%)\n \n So that's what I think I think. For gaming purposes, I will start with 0% and adjust upward as events suggest otherwise.",

Erdogan is not likely to put forward a constitution that doesn't include the expansion of presidential powers - but such a constitution is unlikely to get the necessary support to pass without support from the Kurds - and the deal with the PKK is currently fraying, which will erode support among the Kurds - suggesting that the constitutional reform process is likely to be put on hold for a while, especially given the other (more pressing) domestic issues that Erdogan and the AKP are facing.",

        "In February, Moody's put the UK on \"negative outlook\", implying a 30% chance of losing its AAA credit rating within 18 months.   http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17021986  In March, Fitch changed its outlook to negative. This signalled a \"slightly greater than 50% chance\" that Britain would lose its AAA rating with Fitch in the next two years.  http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/apr/30/credit-ratings-country-fitch-moodys-standard  But S&P reaffirmed the UK's AAA rating in April and gave it a stable outlook (with no change to negative outlook since). At that time, S&P stated: \"We expect economic policy to focus on closing the fiscal gap, and we forecast the government's net debt burden to peak in 2013 [at about 87% of GDP].\"   http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17708678  So Fitch's and Moody's \"negative outlook\" means a 30% to 50+% chance of a downgrade in 18 to 24 months. S&P hasn't issued a negative outlook and isn't forecasting the UK's debt burden to peak until sometime in 2013 (perhaps suggesting no downgrade before then unless something major happens to cause it to alter its forecast).  Since the ending date of this question is April 1, 2013 (a little over 10 months from now), it seems to me that the probabilities attached to the Fitch and Moody \"negative outlooks,\" coupled with S&P's stable outlook, argue against the UK's credit rating being downgraded within the timeframe of this question.

        "Some objective facts:\n - Western countries will not intervene military to save Ukraine, probably not even in the face of a massive Russian invasion of the country\n - Russia military might far surpasses that of Ukraine\n - Russia is economically a midget compared to US-EU\n - US-EU economic sanctions can hurt Russia in a meaningful way\n - Ukraine is an economic disaster, and maybe also be so politically\n - Putins domestic popularity has climbed strongly following annexation of Crimea.\n \n Theories abound about Putin and his plans, or lack of plans. I think it is safe to say that we know that we do not know what Putin is up to.\n \n \"Mock\" referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk in May showed an overwhelming support for independence from Ukraine and possibly also willingness to be annexed by Russia.\n \n Russia continues to send vital humanitarian aid to eastern Ukraina, regardless of the cease fire, and without informing Red Cross as per agreement between Ukraine and Russia.\n \n Eastern Ukraine is of vital economic interest to Ukraine, and thus also Russia.\n \n Pro russian rebels appear fully capable of coordinated military action, and are likely supported in many ways by Russia (arms, men, intelligence and logistics). Government forces currently hold the airport in Donetsk, but we shouldnt be surprised if the rebels are able to overrun it.\n \n Russian gas supplies to Ukraine now come on a pre-paid basis. These supplies are vital to Ukraine and leaves the country in an interestingly difficult situation.\n \n While it is not given that Russia will annex additional territory in Ukraine just yet, it is certain that Ukraine faces a severe threath against its sovereignty that will at best erode the country gradually to submission (over decades). If Ukraine signals further steps to integrate with Europe, it will only heigthen Russias resolve to stop Ukraine from doing so. The situation of a \"frozen\" conflict appears to be Ukraines best hope for its future.\n \n To sum up, an annexation appears somewhat likely, as there is little to stop Russia from doing so. There is a limit to how large economic sanctions US-EU want to use right now, as they might need to be able to save the \"large guns\" for later as the situation develops. The next few weeks will probably be decisive. If Russia annexes Donetsk/Luhansk, what happens then?",
        "I think Putin wants to back away from bellicose actions that could result in even more sanctions without looking like he is backing away.

        "Based on this source:  http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/08/us-iran-space-idUSBRE9770A920130808 Reuters reporting on August 8, 2013 Jane's report that Iran has new rocket site \"for its space program\" likely to be used for ballistic missile testing.  Wikileaks documents indicate US Intelligence Community believed Iran received BM-25 (f/k/a Russian R-27 submarine) missiles from Iran (range of 2,000 mi/3,200 km) http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/middleeast/29missiles.html  This Congressional Research Service report from 12/6/2012 is an excellent backgrounder: http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R42849.pdf  Iran&acirc;\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Ballistic Missile and Space Launch Programs Congressional Research Service  \"Over time, it appears that some of these missile parts and components, or at least their design features, seem to have made their way into North Korean and Iranian missile and space launch programs. Postol has made this argument in assessing the Iranian Safir space launch missile, which has a second stage that appears to use the two vernier thrust chambers and common turbopump from the R-27. In addition, the unusual spatial arrangement of the two thrust chambers, their hydraulic mounts and the conical shape of the stage&acirc;\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds back-end are essentially the same as that on the R-27. Some of this is touched on briefly in the section on Iran&acirc;\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds space launch program.\" (p. 32)  So for the sake of keeping this question manageable for me, I will answer this on the assumption that the Iranian space program is both genuine and a proxy for ballistic missile testing. Rather than an overtly military test, I think it very likely that a test of the North Korean-manufactured BM-25 propulsion system would be in the guise of a satellite rocket launch.   So I will reframe this question as, Is Iran's space program likely to test launch a rocket that incorporates the BM-25 propulsion system by May 1, 2014 -- i.e., within the next 8 months?   The CRS report I cited indicates that the US and NATO were aware of secret Iranian tests of medium-range missiles in real time in 2010 and 2011 but the US delayed reporting this to the media, possibly because of the delicacy of negotiations with Russia taking place at the time. This is a good reminder that resolution criteria effectively often hinge on corroboration from official US gov't sources -- not just whether the event probably happened based on widespread reporting from anonymous sources. See, e.g., last season's widely reported (but not officially acknowledged by Jordan or the US -- or IARPA) cross border clash between Syrian and Jordanian (US?) forces.  Point being, there is precedent to suggest a non-trivial possibility that our core media sources will not publish qualifying articles in real time, but only after the release of info has been vetted by the White House/NATO. An April launch might not be acknowledged/reported in \"definitive\" form until August 2014. Since such an Iranian launch would likely violate UN Resolution 1929, it simply may not be politic for the US to \"out\" the Iranians until after a delay, depending on the needs of the moment. So I think the likelihood of a launch during the window is somewhat more likely than the \"official\" reporting to trigger positive resolution.  ",

However, we do know that Russian involvement is likely given their annexing of the Crimea and satellite images of Russian MRLS units positioned with ground markings consistent of rockets ignited from the mobile launchers.\n \n With all of that being said, and the shaky evidence we have thus far, it seems as if a better than 50/50 chance can be surmised, but much above that without additional facts is unwarranted at this time.",
        "(Reuters) - Bank of Japan board member Takahide Kiuchi said on Wednesday he sees high hurdles to additional quantitative easing because increasing debt purchases would be unlikely to have as much impact as when the central bank first launched the policy last year.  Kiuchi, speaking to reporters after meeting with business leaders in Otsu, western Japan, also said that while it technically may be possible to double the central bank's government debt purchases, such a move would do more harm than good.  Kiuchi is known for his pessimistic outlook on the economy, which places him in the minority on the central bank's nine-member board. On the other side, (Reuters) - Almost two-thirds of Japanese firms expect the Bank of Japan will increase its stimulus in the first six months of 2014, a Reuters poll showed, underscoring the pressure on the central bank to remain the engine of growth under Abenomics.  The results of the monthly Reuters Corporate Survey also showed broad support for the toughest economic policy decision Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to face in the year ahead - pushing ahead with a further sales-tax increase to 10 percent.   Too difficult a decision to take within 60 days, especially with a sales tax increase to come into effect  http://www.iii.co.uk/news-opinion/reuters/news/154960 http://www.iii.co.uk/news-opinion/reuters/news/154693",

Why not encourage India to convert the surplus grain into ethanol and sell it to China, for example? India could finance its subsidy outlays to its poor farmers with the revenue created from selling fuel that China needs, and in the process, create a lot of jobs. \n \n My initial forecast here presumes that if the WTO food subsidy rules are approved, India would sign off, making the vote unanimous, which would lead to approval before 1-1-15. My forecast also assumes that if the WTO subsidy rules are not approved, India will not back down, leading to a \"no\" outcome.

The air test is considered unlikely because of potential radioactive fallout over Chine, NK main supporter.  Both a salvo and vertical mine would require additional resources over past test.\n \n Since the 38north article linked on the info page shows no current activity at the test site, and past tests have required 6-8 weeks of effort before a detonation, it appears time is running out on this question.

They're not getting rid of the protests completely, but they've been effective enough.\n http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/10/hong-kong-police-clear-protest-barricades-2014101512237584208.html\n \n CY Leung is being investigated, giving Beijing a reason to pressure him to step down so they can replace him with a different Beijing-friendly leader.\n http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/hong-kong-chief-executive-cy-leung-faces-questions-over-secret-7m-payout-from-australian-firm-20141008-1134yv.html#ixzz3FXFIkmAx\n \n The police have also been allowing triad (read: Chinese mafia) members, paid mainlander thugs/poor folks, and anti-HK protesters across barricades to beat up HK protesters. Keep in mind most of the protesters are wealthy college kids - they don't want to be victims of violence and many of them have the resources to simply leave HK if it comes down to that. Don't think of these protesters in the same line as Tiananmen, or the US Civil Rights movements of the 1960s. \n Also keep this in mind: When Beijing wants to use the stick against these protests, they have thugs who aren't associated with the PRC to do that. This allows Westerners to think that the HK protests aren't that popular (which, really, they're not) while keeping Beijing's hands clean.\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/10/03/hong-kongs-battle-lines-harden-after-mob-attacks-protesters/\n \n Quite a few people think this will end up like Tiananmen. Couple reasons I disagree with this:\n 1) The political and economic climate today: the PRC has integrated itself into too many markets to try something so drastic, especially when they have other avenues to pursue in reducing tensions in HK. This would also be a blow to their soft power which they've been trying to cultivate over the past decade, and would give Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam excuses to be more bullish against China's attempts at encroachment via the ADIZ and spats over islands (in Taiwan's case, Taiwan itself).\n 2) Before Tiananmen, there was another large student protest in 1986 that was suppressed through non-violent means. Part of the reason Tiananmen blew up into such an event and fiasco was the schism in PRC leadership at the time between Zhao Ziyang (in favor of political reforms) and Deng Xiaoping + Li Peng (more hardline) - this was also at the time when much of the Soviet Eastern Block was falling, and the PRC hardline leadership essentially faced a real possibility of the PRC dictatorship and government structure crumbling if Tiananmen continued.\n There is no such risk with these protests, and there is no such mainland support for these protests. The greatest risk to the PRC in giving in to these protests is the setting of precedent.\n \n \n So overall, here's how I see this playing out:\n The CY Leung investigation will blow up and be handed to ICAC. The result will be Leung being forced to step down.\n Beijing will take the stance of \"Look, we didn't interfere to protect Leung. He's obviously not a puppet - he was corrupt and dealt with accordingly. This is a perfect example of the 'one country, two systems' relationship you want.\"\n Beijing will replace Leung with a more competent yet still pro-Beijing leader.\n Beijing will pass this lack of intervention off as a concession to the Scholarism/Occupy Central movement's demands (keeping in mind it's likely a source from Beijing was the original leak to Garnaut to kick that investigation off). The replacement will probably stage talks with OC, but nothing will come of them.\n No meaningful longterm changes will occur (at least, not by 12/2014). The protests will dissipate as Leung gets removed and talks ensue (and also as people need to return to their jobs/classes, leadership in the Scholarism movement falters, etc). Disenchanted students and protesters will leave HK, creating voids that will be filled with rising mainlander upper-middle class and upper-class citizens who can afford the laughably high HK housing prices and want to live in the veritable shopping mall that HK is becoming.",

The other factor is that USA and Uganda announced suspension of efforts to capture Kony after internal turmoil in CAR. That means not only weakening of the efforts per se but also somehow less risky operational environment for Kony with CAR being in the state in which it is.  So I don't see any of the options - Yes or No - as being particularly likely. Still, in the time frame, I see Kony escaping capture as more likely then not.

        "The article below highlights some of the issues suggesting that a negative report is looming for the third quarter:  http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/10/economist-explains-14\n \n \"IN THE second quarter of this year the German economy shrank by 0.2%. Economists expect it to contract again in the third quarter, meaning that the economy will technically be in recession.\"\n \n The underlying reasoning rests in the significant portion of Germany's GDP that is dependent on exports.\n \n \"The German economy is powered by exports. Its current-account balance (the difference between the money it receives from the outside world and what it spends abroad) is one of the world's largest, at 7% of GDP. It is an open economy: its ratio of exports to GDP is double China's. So when Germany's exports fall by 6%, as they did in August, you know it is bad news. In recent months the global economy has turned against Germany. About 6% of German exports go to China, especially what economists call \"capital\" goods such as heavy machinery. China's economy is slowing: in 2010 GDP growth was 10% but this year it will be more like 7%. What is more, China is rebalancing away from investment-which requires capital goods-towards consumption, which does not. Germany has also been hit by slow growth in the 17 other euro-zone countries, where it sends 40% of its exports. To add to this mess, Russia, which takes 3% of Germany's exports, is facing a full-blown economic crisis as low oil prices and Western sanctions hit home.\"\n \n Germany has, up until now, maintained a rigid policy of avoiding debt to create stimulus and has remained indifferent to the downturns in the other nations within the Eurozone.  It appears, however, that this downturn, coupled with declining demand from China and the effects of sanctions over the Russia/Ukraine situation, are all taking a significant toll on German exports.  Unemployment in Germany rose in September and the government also projected a reduction in annual economic growth from 1.8% to 1.2% for 2014. German consumer sentiment indices have also gone down.\n \n In the 2nd quarter, Germany's GDP exhibited negative growth of .2% and it would appear that economic conditions have continued to deteriorate since then.  Also, most recently, there has been some indication that Merkel's position on stimulus and attention to the Eurozone has begun to shift albeit slightly.  After an extended period of rigidity in reaction to Europe's sliding towards recession, even a modest shift may indicate recognition by Merkel of the impact that the surrounding economies are now having on Germany and that economic reports for the third quarter (yet unpublished) will require more aggressive political/economic action.  \n \n For all of these reasons, I think there will be a report of negative GDP for the third quarter and will continue to monitor the economic reports.",

Moreover, is seems the role that North Korea place in China's geopolitical strategy has changed from practical to irrelevant. It used to be that North Korea was a buffer to Western imperialism and a buffer from there citizenry being exposed to western ideals. At this point where is the military or political benefit of propping up this 'enigmatic' regime. China is South Korea's largest trading partner and South Korea China's sixth largest trading partner. China's current geopolitical strategy is more about economics than ideals. The only reason not to let North Korea implode is that it is more expensive than simply subsidizing. Therefore, things seem ripe for not only folks to come to the table, but actually get a deal.  North Korean radio called the delay of transfer 'a crime against a nation' and has long claimed that its nuclear program was created to combat the US forces on the Peninsula. At this point the US and South Korea see it as a bargaining chip. ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/world/asia/south-koreans-ask-us-to-reconsider-timing-of-military-hand-off.html ) Either way I would weight this condition significantly, if anything as a indicator of the status of relations among the parties.    Having said that, the US current stance in terms of what North Korea would have to do in order for the US to come to the table may be a bridge too far for North Korea.

        "The expansion by IS has been interpreted as a major threat to the interests of all world powers, some more than others. The US has been careful in how it deals with the issue, given it recently withdrew from Iraq amid strong criticisms from the more hawkish elements in Congress. Going back in, at least in the form of committing ground troops, is widely unpopular both in government and society. That's why the Obama administration has tread carefully regarding the response it should take to counter the threat. Although it finally went on with limited airstrikes in IS positions in Iraq, going into Syria is more complicated because of the role of other world powers with interests there (namely Russia and China). Russia has been supportive of the Assad regime, but it also sees IS as a threat. The same goes with China, although the Chinese are usually less assertive on the issue. Yet given threats by IS to expand its caliphate beyond Iraq and Syria, and its direct threats to Russia for its support of the Assad regime, Russia will likely support a collective effort to strike at IS in Syria. In fact, Russia may be the key to having the Syrian regime on board such an operation, as it would likely emerge from a UN Security Council resolution (a NATO operation is being built, but Russia would not go along given the former's role in the Ukrainian crisis). A collective action sanctioned by the UNSC would need Russia's and China's support (or at least not vetoing it), and Russia would go along if that meant hurting IS and at the same time keeping Assad in power. China would also go along if it meant limiting IS's expansion and influence, but also only if Assad's ousting is not in the plans. \n \n CHAMPS KNOW\n - Comparison classes \n *Limited airstrikes in Iraq with support/acknowledgement of Iraqi government; Syrian government called for US strikes BUT only with coordination with Syrian forces. \n \n - Hunt for the right information: \n *Intervention= airstrikes OR deployment of troops; it's occurring in Iraq; Iraq-Syria border is practically inexistent, so striking in Syria wouldn't be that controversial unless Russia and China object strongly\n \n - Know the power players, their goals, and motivation to prevail on an issue\n *Syria sees IS as a threat to its survival, but also as an opportunity to ramp up\n *United States sees IS as a terrorist threat, as unfinished business (Congress has picked on Obama for withdrawing too soon), and is looking for the best (least costly economically and politically) way to counter the threat (that means not committing boots to the ground, after Iraq War) by relying on allies and a coalition, as it argues it is a threat to all the world\n *Other bordering countries: Israel and Jordan (both US allies) are at risk of IS incursions, so would support a US invasion\n * Russia could be a broker when dealing with Syrian government for airstrikes within Syria's borders, probably agreed in UN Security Council (very unlikely to go along with a NATO-led attack because of its role in Ukrainian crisis); IS threatened Russia for its ties with Bashar al-Assad\n * China has its own jihadist threat in Xinjiang; IS threatened to expand to other parts of the world, including China; China could use this as a way to bolster its anti-terrorists campaign in Xinjiang, and could welcome (or at least not veto) a UN-lead coalition against IS\n \n - Institutional Norms, Rules, ad Protocols\n * UN Security Council could pass a resolution if China and Russia don't veto it; US could bring Russia and China aboard, as IS could pose a threat to both Russian and Chinese interests as well (Chechnya and Xinjiang, respectively)\n ",

Russia's humanitarian relief effort will likely give Putin some time to figure out how to proceed. \n \n I think that Russia has an incentive to not invade Ukraine, at least in the next few months.

The Kremlin's most recent tactic of humanitarian relief could temporarily shore up its weakening position in southeastern Ukraine while aligning with the cautious preferences of most Russians. Yet if the Kremlin still decides to escalate, that decision will likely divide Russian society more deeply than at any other time during Putin's rule.\n \n Vladimir Putin cannot count on solid public support for open intervention in Ukraine in part because relatively few Russians perceive serious external threats to Russia from the West. According to a recent poll by WCIOM, the Russian public opinion firm, only 18 percent of respondents worried about a military threat from the West. Equally significant, given constant Kremlin warnings about American aggression, only 13 percent of respondents in the same poll felt that Russia should send forces into eastern Ukraine even if NATO intervened in the conflict. Given these sentiments, the capacity of the Russian state to mobilize society for extended military conflict, and its accompanying costs, is fragile. Such an assessment is reinforced by the fact that many Russians believe that if war does breaks out over Ukraine, it will be because pro-Russian separatists in southeastern Ukraine have dragged Russia into the conflict.\n \n Putin's Public Opinion Challenge | The National Interest - http://goo.gl/lKBFvX",

I can't find any wording that excludes the Syrian army.\n \n Aside from that, some initial thoughts: \n \n (N1) There could be unacknowledged strikes, which wouldn't count.  But I think the US military has a strong motivation to acknowledge strikes.\n (N2) Unintentional attacks wouldn't count.  But last year's situation, where Israel acknowledged firing into Syria in response to unacknowledged firing in the other direction, presumably would count (much to the chagrin of some supers).\n (N3) Per Koloj's question, I'm guessing a CIA strike wouldn't count (not military - maybe this is a good request for clarification), and also might not be acknowledged.\n (N4) The US would prefer to avoid striking Syria if it can.\n (N5) Can the US legally strike in Syria?  I heard a radio report about a US congressman proposing a bill to explicitly allow strikes against IS anywhere.\n \n (Y1) Three months.  That's a pretty long time given the operational tempo of IS, and the US as well.  \n (Y2) The US has drones gathering intelligence over Syria.  The media's presumption is that is a prelude to strikes.\n (Y3) Executions of journalists, with more to follow.  Paraphrasing James Baker's comments to his Iraqi counterpart in early 1991: If you do such and such bad thing, \"the American public would demand vengeance, and we have the means to extract it.\"\n (Y4) A lot of pundits say the US needs to strike IS in Syria as well as Iraq.) \n (Y5) An attack on any armed group in Syria counts.\n (Y6) Come to think of it, there doesn't even need to be an attack.  Deployment of troops counts.  What about deploying an armed Predator in Syrian airspace, but without an actual strike? \n (Y7) Lots of other countries could get involved, although I would put the highest percentage on the US: \n   (a) Israel\n   (b) UK?\n   (c) Iran\n   (d) Saudi Arabia?\n   (e) UAE?

Thus, pressure from EU is off the table in that sense BUT the pipeline will run through Europe (over which EU will have a say) if the big plan is a pipe from Russia to Europe.\n \n The construction of the Serbian stretch of the pipeline is due to start in October, the head of Gazprom's international projects department Alexander Siromyatin said on Tuesday.\n \n According to Wikileaks: Moscow is using Romania to put pressure on neighbouring Bulgaria as part of an energy game being played between Russia's South Stream pipeline project and its EU rival Nabucco. \n Romania seems to have no objections to this scheme and is clearly convinced that it will be able to choose which project it wants to participate in at the end. \n \n The rival ventures have planned to construct pipelines to transfer natural gas to Europe; from Russia in the case of South Stream; from the Middle East and across Turkey in the case of Nabucco. Both projects are supposed to start delivering gas in 2015, but neither pipeline has been built yet and the exact transit routes are still unclear. \n \n Bulgaria depends entirely on Russian deliveries (WikiLeaks). Separately, in Bucharest, chairman of the management committee of the Russian group Gazprom Aleksey Miller said he did not have any doubts regarding the South Stream project financing or its completion on time. (Leaks) Also: The South Stream gas pipeline, designed to transport 31 billion cubic metres of natural gas annually, will begin from Russia and, through the Black Sea, it will get to Bulgaria, where it will divide into two branches: one towards Greece and Italy and the second towards Serbia, Hungary and Austria.\n \n Consdering this pipeline is to be completed in 2015 and operational in 2018, seems likely to resume work.\n ",

Extrapolate this probability out and you wind up with an even chance of soldiers being killed by in action by June of next year, which seems like a dire enough outcome as is! . The tensions in this conflict still mean that the likelihood of live rounds being fired in the near future is high, but I predict that any shooting will involve drones or other unmanned facilities instead of crewed aircraft or ships.

Doubt for this comes from the fact that it will take time for THAAD to be deployed and NK may seize the chance to test before a defense system is in place.\n \n I also suppose that if THAAD is not accepted, the chances are somewhat higher of a missile test by NK since they will not fear embarassment as much.\n \n Adjustments may come as rumours leak and rhetoric builds but this question contains so many geopolitical variables that it is very challenging to guess the moves and counter-moves of the hundreds of key actors.",

        "First, what's the market consensus? 10-year BTPs are about +350 vs Bunds implying (if you assume 60% recovery) about a 9% annual probability of default. That's a risk-neutral probability and it's very sensitive to the (unknown) recovery assumption, but I think it's fair to say the consensus is somewhere between 5% and 10%. But it changes every day.\n\n\n\nNow 5%-10% is a fairly high default probability, but not unreasonable due to the structural issues noted in other comments.\n\n\n\nThis is a long term average probability. I'd agree with the comments that Italy is probably easily able to avoid default in the near term. However, two reasons to be cautious are (a) the market is capable of putting unexpected pressure on Italy, as we saw just a month ago, and (b) Italy's running a primary surplus, so default would in theory not be as painful as it is in, e.g., Greece.\n\n\n\nStill, since default would probably mean significant contagion, a series of bank nationalizations (not just in Italy) and a change of Government, policymakers have a very strong incentive to avoid it at all costs.",
        "Unless the nuclear talks fail spectacularly, this sale seems unlikely. A purchase of the system would only serve to antagonize the USA and push Iran closer to Russia. The actions of Iran in the recent past months seems to indicate that the Iranian leadership is trying to move back into the international world, instead of further isolating itself (like Russia is doing). While the nuclear talks are still ongoing, and while there is still a chance of lifting sanctions, I believe there is no chance that Iran would purchase the system.\n However, it seems unlikely that any Western country would agree to supply Iran with weapons, so that leaves Russia with few, if any, competitors for Iran's business. If Iran believes it needs an anti-ballistic missile system, it's only option is Russia.\n ",

        "Not likely. This Forbes take by Ken Rapoza offers some reasons why, although it is a stretch to say that Levy is \"Lula's man.\" He served under Lula for a few years as the straight man Chicago boy treasury secretary for Lula'a corrupt cabinet boss and former boutique Trotskiye mayor of Riberao Preto Antonio Palocci. Palocci (pronounce like the American politician Pelosi). Here is Reuters bio on him. http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/27/br-profile-finmin-idUSL1N0C4GWO20150327\n \n Here is Ken Rapoza's take...\n  http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/25/why-impeaching-brazils-president-dilma-is-a-bad-idea/2/\n \n Lula still has a 49 percent approval-popularity while Dilma continues to tank. But in my view, GJP has done a disservice to forecasters by dumping the entire English translation by MIT of the 1988 Brazil constitution when someone, perhaps an intern at GJP could have taken the time to provide only the relevant information on impeachment. Perhaps this is to promote people checking the \"hunt for info\" box in the \"check all that apply\" section to avoid being prompted to do so;)\n \n At any rate, in the succession drama, everyone in the succession if Dilma is impeached or resigns is tainted by the Lava Jato (Petrobras) scandal in testimony held by the Federal Police and other judicial entities involved (a lot of duplication for political reasons here). That is a major complication that will slow the process beyond 68 days from now without doubt.\n \n Secondly, the precedent for the only impeachment that has happened during the current string of elected governments is based on \"impeachable acts\" committed by a president during the term of his (Collor) presidency. This precedent suggests that Dilma would need to be impeached for actions she has performed during her current (second term) as president, and since she has made a right turn on the economy with the appointment of Levy, there aren't any. \n \n For impeachment enthusiasts to attempt to bring what she did or did not do during her first term as president because it would compromise the succession line to the presidency and possibly mean a new election, which Rapoza of Forbes points out.  Current Justice Minister Cardoso says Dilma will not be impeached, he has served in the position since 2011. And Grey Eminence, neoconserative former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the opposition Brazil Social Democratic Party (don't let name mislead you) says that he thinks it is a \"bad idea.\"\n \n Dilma will travel outside Brazil later this month to attemd the pro-business Summit of the Americas in Panama, which means that vice president Temer of her tenuous coalition partner the PMDB party (Brazilian Popular Democratic Movement) will technically be in charge of the country. She will also travel outside Brazil in June to attend the 2015 BRICS summit in Moscow, hosted by Vladimir Putin, when, once again. Temer will technically be in charge of government. \n \n In the time frame provided for this forecasting problem, resignation, \"palace coup\" or \"impeachment\" don't seem likely because it would rip the nation apart and jeopardize its economic future as nation-state, \"global governance\" entity, what have you. Dilma's health is excellent. She has been losing weight with the help of an Argentine endocrinologist,and is doing an on the fly makeover. As they used to say in the early political simulation game \"Hidden Agenda\"... \"you are still presidente, presidente.\"\n  \n \n ",

        "2012 was the least amount of sea ice over an entire year.  2010 and 2011 were trending towards that low and 2013 rebounded well back towards more ice.  However arctic temperatures this year so far appear to be a bit higher than last year (I am having an awful time finding simple charts of this) in fact they resemble those of 2012 the year of the minimum.  That said, recently 2014 and 2013 temperatures aren't that different.  Earlier in the year when 2014 was being consistently warmer than 2013 there was less sea ice extent this year.   Right now however 2014 is just slightly ahead of the same point in 2013 in terms of sea ice yet at this point 2014 is still looking slightly warmer than the same point in 2013.  Water in the Arctic Ocean circulates up past Norway and the sea temperatures off Norway are just a tad above average which might suggest a slight trend to Arctic ice melt but it doesn't look dramatic.  Based almost entirely on the fact that 2014 looks to be slightly warmer than 2013 over the past month or two yet the sea ice is holding just slightly higher in range (about 5%) I'd have to go with 2014 three weeks out holding on to an edge.  In the previous three weeks from today (8/23) the ice dropped 17% thus making up that 5% difference in the next three weeks would be quite a swing.  So I'd give this a slight edge towards NO.

In early August, the US (a strong and vocal opponent of Kurdish independence) began providing military assistance to the Kurds in their fight against ISIS; other KRG allies who oppose independence have also supplied military assistance.  On 8/12/14, al-Maliki lost his bid for another term, creating the possibility for future political compromise in Baghdad, and KRG ministers have since rejoined the administration. The KRG has also experienced legal and political setbacks in its attempts to market and transport independent Kurdish oil shipments.\n On 8/12/14, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari confirmed in an interview with the Washington Post that \"priorities have changed\" and the independence referendum has been \"put aside\" so that the KRG can focus on defeating ISIS and forming a new government in Baghdad (washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/lally-weymouth-interviews-former-iraqi-foreign-minister-hoshyar-zebari/2014/08/12/98f4a838-2257-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html). \n If the independent election commission previously approved by the KRG parliament moves foward with establishing protocols and a timeline for a referendum, I will adjust my prediction accordingly.",

        "Comparison Classes:\n \n Kurdistan Regional Government President Barzani has threatened secession in the past.

Barzani has also proposed a referendum in Kirkuk and analysts (see Other perspectives link) say this is the one he holds most dearly while he's ready to negotiate for the other. However see also considerations on the feasability of this latter referendum in Norms & Protocols. \n \n \n Recently Kurdistan has increased its oil export capacity, which is pivotal to reach economic independence,\n \n Source: http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/19/us-iraq-security-oil-kurdistan-idUSKBN0GJ14K20140819?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews \n \n but it is still strapped for cash and lacks the infrastructure to increase exports substantially. \n Source: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28103124?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter\n \n Adjust:\n \n I see as an enabling scenario the increasing insecurity and the inability of the new Iraq prime minister to create a government of unity. If this happens within one month I will increase the possibility for the referendum to be held by 30%.\n \n \n Select Effort: I will weekly look for new information regarding the referendum.\n \n Know Players:\n \n Turkey has strong economic ties with Kurdistan and is its main economic partner. Turkey is gradually changing its view regarding Kurdish independence, looking to see what will happen in Iraq in the next months before declaring its support to independence. In any case it is going to be pivotal in the quest for independence. \n \n Turkey is an ally of the US, which are contrary to Kurdistan independence. \n \n The risk of becoming too dependent on Turkey however, might push the leadership to look for other allies, at the moment absent. \n \n The third party (PUK) is strenghtening its ties with Iran, which is concerned regarding Kurdistan independence and an ally of Russia, generally contrary to independence of small territories from states.\n \n \n IRAQ: In this moment of crisis and political transition they need unity and military support from Kurdistan. Therefore Kurdistan knows they are in a good negotiating situation to have gains, especially when it comes to the permission to export oil to Turkey (which was the source of conflict early this year) and buying more time to prepare for a future independence.\n \n The call for a referendum seems to be just a way to put pressure on Baghdad as Barzani has done earlier. \n \n However al-Abadi, the new prime minister of Iraq comes from the same Dawa party as al-Maliki and just on January cut Iraqi Kurdistan from the national budget when the Kurds refused to let Baghdad monopolize oil production and exports even though the Kurds promised to share the revenue with the rest of Iraq.\n \n \n Source:http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/21082014\n \n The 18% share of profits that Baghdad was giving to Kurdistan is much more remunerative than the control of Kirkuk.\n \n al-Abadi has a bad record regarding his attitude towards Kurds and he is likely (70%) to fail in the hard task of creating a true government of unity. Considering the IS menace, he might focus on allying with the Sunnis and ignoring the requests of the Kurds.\n \n \n Barzani: These kind of threats are his trademark even though they never take place. An anonymous source stated that Barzani was not as clear regarding the referendum as the media outlets described.\n Source: http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/iraq-kurdistan-barzani-puk-division-independence-iran-turkey.html\n \n Kurdistan Government: There is not political unity among the different parties regarding the usefulness of the referendum at this moment of time. Gorran and some members of PUK are opposing it. \n \n While Kurds negotiators might be posturing at Baghdad, Kurdistan is aware of his economic vulnerability.\n \n Norms and protocols\n \n Despite calls of Barzani for the referendum to be held within 2014, experts say the process of creating a commission might take months.\n Kurds are in fact preparing the legal framework in the Kurdistan regional parliament for a referendum on self-determination.\n \n There is still nothing on the parliament website regarding the referendum. I found nothing on the constitution regarding the time or the procedures for organizing a referendum.\n \n However on 24 July the Kurdistan Regional Government passed a law that allows the commission to hold elections, referendums and fix dates for voting without having to refer to Baghdad.\n \n The law makes reference to \"Kurdistan,\" not the Kurdistan Region, making it applicable in all territories controlled by the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government since June, when the KRG moved forces into areas it considers its own, and that were abandoned by Iraqi forces retreating under a jihadi-led advance.\n \n Source:http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/240720141\n \n Holding the referendum in Kirkuk area will however be considered illegal following the Article 140 of the Iraqi constitution. KRG will hardly find any international support if they try to annex an area they have been controlling for one month without the consent of Baghdad (which is unlikely to give up a rich territory so easily). \n \n Source: http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/11072014\n \n Kirkuk council has a majority of PUK members who might linger in giving their support to the referendum, considering their political stance (see above). \n \n I believe that the commission will consider an appropriate time for the organisation of the referendum and campaigning. This is why 3 months seem a time too short. \n \n Other perspectives\n \n An energy advisor of the KRG just at the beginning of this year stated that it will take five more years before Kurdistan can \"afford\" independence\n Source: http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/25012014\n \n Here is a detailed analysis on why independence is still not feasible for Kurdistan: http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/the-kurdish-move-towards-independence   \n \n Wildcards:\n \n If al-Abadi attempt to create a government of unity will fail completely and Kurds will not accept his attempts to find a compromise, Kurdistan might speed the process for the referendum. \n \n A negotiator gave three months to solve the issue of the disputed territories, this would leave very little time to actually hold a referendum. \n \n http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/df5896e0-27bb-11e4-ae44-00144feabdc0.html \n ",

        "This is a battle between Price and Market share. that is, sacrifice price to retain market share or profit from price and sacrifice market share. If OPEC cuts production, it is likely that US shale oil will keep chugging along and thus neutralize the production cuts, as well as take market share away from OPEC. \n \n If OPEC does not cut production, prices will sink, and likely will make Shale oil production a less attractive venture. The key question is: what is that price threshold that will make US shale oil to feel unattractive? \n \n This article (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-15/opec-finding-u-s-shale-harder-to-crack-as-rout-deepens.html) has some answers along those lines: \"About 2.6 million barrels of daily production, or 2.8 percent of global output, requires an oil price of $80 a barrel or more to be profitable, the IEA said. Only about 4 percent of U.S. shale output needs prices above that level, it said. Canadian synthetic oil projects are the most dependent on high prices, with about a quarter needing oil to remain above $80, the agency said.Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in hydrocarbon-rich underground shale layers have helped U.S. oil production grow 65 percent in the past five years to the highest level since 1986. That's reduced crude imports by more than 3.1 million barrels a day since peaking in 2005. Production per well was projected to increase in fields in North Dakota, Texas and Colorado, the Energy Information Administration said yesterday. Companies are getting more oil per dollar spent drilling, driving costs down by as much as $30 a barrel since 2012, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Longson said in a report Oct. 13.\" \n \n Thus due to American ingenuity (GO USA!) we are producing more profitable oil. I believe that the only rational course for OPEC given that oil production is actually slated to increase in the US and other non-OPEC producers is to battle it out with price rather than quantity. Thus I think that OPEC would let prices sink rather than cut production in the short term. \n \n See this article for more analysis along these lines: (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/13/us-oil-saudi-policy-idUSKCN0I201Y20141013)\n \"Saudi Arabia is quietly telling the oil market it would be comfortable with much lower oil prices for an extended period, a sharp shift in policy that may be aimed at slowing the expansion of rival producers including those in the U.S. shale patch. Some OPEC members including Venezuela are clamoring for production cuts to push oil prices back up above $100 a barrel.\n But Saudi officials have given a different message in meetings with investors and analysts: the kingdom, OPEC's largest producer, will accept oil prices below $90 per barrel, and perhaps down to $80, for as long as a year or two, according to people who have been briefed on the recent conversations.\n The discussions, some in New York over the past week, offer the clearest sign yet that the kingdom is setting aside its longstanding de facto aim of holding prices at around $100 a barrel for Brent crude LCOc1 in favor of retaining market share in years to come.\n The Saudis appear to be betting lower prices - which could strain the finances of some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - will be necessary to pave the way for higher revenue in the medium term, by curbing new investment and further increases in supply from places like the U.S. shale patch or ultra-deepwater, according to the sources, who declined to be identified due to the private nature of the discussions.\n The conversations with Saudi officials did not offer any specific guidance on whether - or by how much - the kingdom might agree to cut output, a move many analysts are expecting in order to shore up a global market that is producing substantially more crude than it can consume. Saudi Arabia pumps around a third of OPEC's oil, or about 9.7 million barrels a day.\n Asked about coming Saudi output curbs, one Saudi official responded \"What cuts?\", according to one of the sources.\n Also uncertain is whether the Saudi briefings to oil market observers represent a new tack it is committed to, or a talking point meant to cajole other OPEC members to join Riyadh in eventually tightening the taps on supply.\n One source not directly involved in the discussions said the kingdom does not necessarily want prices to slide further, but is unwilling to shoulder production cuts unilaterally and is prepared to tolerate lower prices until others in OPEC commit to action.\n \n OPEC ANGST\n With most other members of the cartel unable or unwilling to reduce their own output, the group's next meeting on Nov. 27 is set to be its most difficult in years. OPEC has agreed to cut production only a handful of times in the past decade, most recently in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n On Friday, Venezuela - one of the cartel's most price-sensitive members - became the first to call openly for emergency action even earlier. Foreign Minister Rafael Ramirez said \"it doesn't suit anyone to have a price war, for the price to fall below $100 a barrel\".\n On Sunday, Ali al-Omair, oil minister of Saudi Arabia's core Gulf ally Kuwait, appeared to be the first to articulate the emerging view of OPEC's most influential member, saying output cuts would do little to prop up prices in the face of rising production from Russia and the United States.\n \"I don't think today there is a chance that (OPEC) countries would reduce their production,\" state news agency KUNA quoted him as saying.\n Omair said that prices should stop falling at around $76 to $77 a barrel, citing production costs in places such as the United States, where a shale oil boom has unexpectedly reversed dwindling output and pushed production to its highest level since the 1980s.\n Saudi oil officials have made no public comments on the deepening swoon in markets. Senior officials did not reply to questions from Reuters about recent briefings.\n \n DON'T BE SURPRISED BELOW $90\n Global benchmark Brent LCOc1 crude oil futures have fallen steadily for almost four months, dropping 23 percent from a June high of over $115 a barrel as fears of a Mideast supply disruption ebbed, U.S. shale production boomed and demand from Europe and China showed signs of flagging. [O/R]\n Brent fell below $88 a barrel on Monday, hitting its lowest in almost four years, after news of the Saudi and Kuwaiti statements.\n \"In light of these comments, one should not expect any OPEC output cuts before the Nov. 27 meeting,\" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo.\n An OPEC delegate from outside the core Gulf Arab group said he did not think OPEC would cut output at the November meeting but added he believed the Saudis should cut output unilaterally:\n \"The question should be posed to Saudi Arabia\".\n The growing difference in opinions means OPEC is heading for its most tense meeting since mid-2011 when it failed to agree on an increase in output despite a loss of Libyan production.\n Until recently, Gulf OPEC members have been saying that the price dip was a temporary phenomenon, betting on seasonal demand in winter to prop up prices. But a growing number of oil analysts now see the latest slide as something more than a seasonal downswing; some say it is the start of a pivotal shift to a prolonged period of relative abundance.\n Rather than fight the decline in prices and cede market share in the face of growing competition, Saudi Arabia appears to be preparing traders for a sea change in prices.\n The Saudis want the world to know that \"nobody should be surprised\" with oil under $90 a barrel, according to one of the people. Another source suggested that $80 a barrel may now be an acceptable floor for the kingdom, although several other analysts said that figure seemed too low. Brent has averaged around $103 since 2010, trading mostly between $100 and $120.\n While the latest discussions are the bluntest efforts yet to signal the shift in Saudi strategy, early signs had already begun sending shivers through the oil market. In early October the kingdom cut its official selling prices more sharply than expected in a bid to maintain customers in Asia, widely seen as the opening shots in a price war for Asian customers.\n \"Riyadh's political floor on oil prices is weakening,\" Robert McNally, a White House adviser to former President George W. Bush and president of the Rapidan Group energy consultancy, wrote in a note to clients following a trip to Saudi last month.\n McNally said he is not aware of any specific Saudi price or timing strategy, but told Reuters that Saudi Arabia \"will accept a price decline necessary to sweat whatever supply cuts are needed to balance the market out of the U.S. shale oil sector.\"\n As that message began to dawn last week, the price rout quickened, with Brent lurching to its lowest level since 2010.\n \"Until about three days ago the absolute and total consensus in the market was the Saudis would cut,\" said McNally. That is no longer a foregone conclusion, he said. \"The market suddenly realizes it is operating without a net.\"",

Joseph Dunford - the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan -remains optimistic, believing the election stalemate will be settled, the security agreement signed and the effort to advise and equip the Afghan forces will continue.\n \n Karzai, who has been trying to bring both sides together to overcome the impasse, met with the two candidates Sunday and again Tuesday after Abdullah's boycott threat. Karzai has said that the inauguration of the new president must happen by Sept. 2. That is just two days before NATO members are expected to meet in Wales.\n \n Major Challenge:\n \n There is not currently a president to sign it and there is a major power struggle. \n \n Further, Abdullah Abdullah, pulled his observers Wednesday from an audit of the country's disputed election over concerns of widespread fraud in a move that throws the already contentious election into further crisis.\n \n The U.S. brokered the audit of the eight million ballots from the country's June presidential runoff as a way to end what had been a debilitating impasse over who would take over from outgoing President Hamid Karzai. But the audit, which was announced in July, has proceeded in fits and starts as both sides have argued strenuously over every ballot.\n \n The U.N. has been helping supervise the audit along with Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission.\n \n The campaign's decision to drop its support for the ballot raises concerns about whether Abdullah's team and those who voted for him would consider any resulting government to be valid. That could have dangerous repercussions in a country still struggling to overcome ethnic and religious divides and battling a resurgent Taliban insurgency.\n \n In my opinion, a president will be declared. The other will be upset. The international community will recognize the result, encouraging the new President to sign a security agreement.",

        "Initial SWAG \n \n Some thoughts: \n \n (1) Apparently there was a 24 March UNSC announcement that I can't find.\n \n http://www.voanews.com/content/united-nations-sanctions-south-sudan/2693463.html\n The U.N. Security Council has expressed \"profound disappointment'' about the failure of South Sudan President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar to finalize a peace deal.\n \n A council statement issued Tuesday again threatened sanctions against \"senior individuals'' whom it deemed \"responsible for actions or policies that threaten the peace, security or stability of South Sudan.''\n \n Fighting in the oil-rich East African country has killed tens of thousands and displaced more than 2 million people.\n \n The Security Council has been considering sanctions for almost a year. Earlier this month, it established a sanctions regime for South Sudan but stopped short of imposing travel bans and asset freezes on officials, or creating an arms embargo.\n \n (2) IMHO timing is a big issue.  Is this something that will actually play out in the next 8 weeks?  It does not seem so.  Google News didn't show anything in the past 3 weeks.  If they express profound disappointment on 24 March, surely they will wait a while before discussing further steps.  Then they have to discuss it, and vote.  If they are really spun up, I suppose they could go through that entire cycle in less than 8 weeks.\n \n (3) The UN could adopt a South Sudan resolution that does not involve an arms embargo.\n http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-25/un-security-council-condemns-south-sudanese-leaders-war-tactics\n The Security Council established a sanctions regime on March 3 to decide on punitive measures that could include asset freezes, travel bans or an arms embargo.\n \n (4) Here is the actual UN 3 March announcement\n http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50231#.VS6dAiHBzGc\n Furthermore, the Council decided that it could impose a travel ban and an assets freeze for an initial period of one year on individuals and entities designated by a sanctions committee to be established through the resolution. The travel ban would apply to individuals, while the assets freeze would apply to individuals as well as entities such as government, opposition or militia groups.\n \n To assist the relevant Sanctions Committee in its work, the Council requested the Secretary-General to set up a five-member panel of experts to provide information relevant to the potential designation of individuals and entities. Renewal of the panel's mandate would be considered no later than 2 March 2016. Among other responsibilities, the panel will collect and analyse information regarding the flow of arms and related military assistance to those undermining the peace process and committing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.\n \n (4) Note \"The United States and European Union have already independently imposed travel bans and asset freezes on commanders on both sides.\" - http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/18/us-southsudan-war-idUSKBN0ME1OR20150318\n \n (5) Is there any reason to believe Russia and/or China would block such a resolution? \n \n (6) It seems to me like a resolution of some kind will happen, unless the opposing sides miraculously stop fighting.  But will it involve an arms embargo?\n \n (7) Apparently the only country shipping arms in the past to South Sudan has been China.  See article below.  But China may have already stopped.  If they have, what is the point of an arms embargo if there are no arms being shipped?  Is there symbolic value in a UN resolution?\n \n http://www.businessinsider.in/This-GIF-shows-how-Chinas-arms-exports-have-exploded-since-2000/articleshow/46691269.cms\n \n A large part of Beijing's weapons trade is in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where China has long been attempting to build political influence to gain access to raw materials, as well as emerging labor and consumer markets.

        "I believe that Iran's blockading of the strait is more or less dependent on the occurrence of a foreign kinetic attack or invasion (in line with a previous question).  There are some circumstances where they may seek to blockade the strait in the absence of such an attack, such as severe non-kinetic provocation (e.g. regime threatening sanctions or other diplomatic activity, significant and aggressive backing of anti-regime proxies or other non-kinetic activities) or widespread internal unrest.  But, I believe their occurrence and Iran's subsequent response to blockade the strait, would be unlikely.  So to all intents and purposes, I see a foreign kinetic attack, or its imminent threat as a \"necessary condition\" for a strait blockade, but not a \"sufficient condition\" - i.e. there are scenarios where such an attack occurs, but Iran does not respond by blockading the strait.  Therefore as I see it, we must consider the following factors: 1. the probability of an attack on Iran; 2. if 1, then the probability that Iran would respond by blockading the strait; and 3. if 1 and 2, the probability that Iran would be successful in blockading the strait.  When you consider the probability of the coincidence of all these factors, to my mind, it lowers my perception of the probability of a yes.

        "While current street protests led by Khan and Qadri brought large scale protests to Islamabad, they were not mirrored across the country at the level that could truly force political change.  Current estimates place the number of protesters still in Islamabad at around 7,000 - by comparison, there are an estimated 20,000 police deployed to the city.  Since Sharif was elected with a nearly 4:1 edge over closest challenger, giving him widespread and mass support across Pakistan, it is highly unlikely the street protests will force his resignation.\n \n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/13/us-pakistan-crisis-idUSKBN0H80DF20140913\n \n In addition, local Islamabad residents are beginning to turn against the protestors, as reported by the NY Times:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/world/asia/beleaguered-islamabad-pakistani-capital-inches-back-to-normal.html\n \n Wildcard factor, as seeforman pointed out, is whether or not the Pakistani military continues to back Sharif, or if he may be subject to a coup for the second time.  However, I assess that given the military's current operations in North Waziristan, it does not have the capacity to manage a coup simultaneously.  Sharif's tacit agreement to allow the operation to continue unopposed is also a selling point for him remaining in office.\n \n http://www.dawn.com/news/1132050",

Even those closest to him are left guessing who is best placed to take on the leadership.\"\n \n The only realistic possibility for Abbas vacating the office is that he dies prior to June 1, but he appears to be in pretty good health for the time being.",

As there is nothing but a bunch of mainstream media on the subject with their \"so called experts\" who are always drummed up to paint a terrible picture to get a mouse click. \n \n I don't really see us or anyone else mobilizing against ISIS. If a country were to help Bashar's army and it was in fact determined that he used chemical weapons.. that would be really bad. If a country helped the rebels and it turned out they used chemical weapons that would also be bad.\n \n This combined with previous, and as far as I can tell still standing, warnings from Russia to not get involved in Syria. So because the US supports the rebels and Russia supports Bashar unless one of the aforementioned switches sides (politcal nightmare for them), than most likely neither country will get involved. Russia is playing a dangerous game as it is. Putin is a master with this and in this particular game of chess I don't see Syria as being worth the risk.  \n \n The focus on Iraq will continue policy makers know that if they can break ISIS in Iraq there is a high potential the rest will fall as well. Why risk getting involved when you may be able to take out two birds with one stone. \n \n In short we continue to assist in Iraq, it plays into our regional plan/desire anyway, leave Syria for now.\n \n As far as wild cards, you never know what Isreal or Iran will do so yea...",

        "BHP and the other major iron Ore miners such as Vale and Rio Tinto have been increasing the production of Iron-ore despite falling prices.  This is counter-intuitive but the big producers are trying to push out the little producers.

Article in the wall street journal commenting on continued increased production. http://online.wsj.com/articles/bhp-plows-ahead-on-iron-ore-production-1412550242\n \n \n According to the article to the following article China is subsidizing its iron-ore production to keep it afloat at these prices -- implying to me that China will continue to produce Iron-Ore.  http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/chinese-traders-tip-iron-ore-to-hit-us70-20141106-11hwam.html \n \n With the spot price at just under $76 there is a strong possibility that we will fall under $71 by the new year. http://www.infomine.com/investment/metal-prices/iron-ore-fines/6-month/",

Does the question require that the forces be acknowledge to be Russian?\n \n The current military situation seems to be settling down in favor of the Ukrainians. However, NATO believes that there is 'high probability' of a Russian invasion (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/nato-russia-ukraine_n_5668122.html). My guess is that this would result in (at the minimum) guerrilla attacks by right front leading to more than 3 casualties.\n \n However, I personally am less certain that Russia will invade. The risk is heightened sanctions which will weaken the regime. Furthermore, the current 'aid convoy' has not made attempts to move into Ukraine. Given the fact that the trucks are empty and the troops are there I'd say there is a decent chance of a humanitarian invasion. In my opinion this would be done by LGM and not Russian uniformed troops. This is a political question and not a military one :)\n \n Thus we require clarification of whether the a fight involving LGM counts under the criteria.

To counter U.S. deployment of missile defense systems in Romania and Poland\n 3. China, not a signatory on the INF, is increasing its cruise missile capability and while a notional ally of Russia, is also a potential foe (especially on the eastern border where the Chinese population outnumbers the Russian one).\n 4. To compensate for Russian deficiencies in the air/sea arena. Russia is a ground power, with air/sea forces serving to augment the ground element and to serve as a strategic deterrent. The United States is mostly an air/sea power, with quite capable ground element that need a lot of time to ramp up.\n 5. To show force and that it is still relevant (e.g. Syria, Ukraine, Georgia, many UNSC votes).\n \n There is a precedence for this: the United States' withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002.

        "Daily Forecast\n News Sourcing\n \n \n **\n \n President Petro Poroshenko has endorsed a referendum on the federalisation of Ukraine, jumpstarting the reforms foreseen by the peace plan to end the conflict with Russia-backed rebels in the country's east.\n \n \"I'm ready to hold a referendum about the structure of the government, if you think it's necessary,\" Poroshenko told a commission which will oversee constitutional reform at its first session on Monday.\n \n Federalisation was one of the key demands made by pro-Russia rebels at the start of the conflict last April as it would give largely Russian-speaking Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine a great degree of autonomy from the central government. But analysts and politicians in Kiev argue such a move would weaken the country and allow Moscow undue influence in its politics.\n \n Poroshenko left no doubt where he stood on the issue, calling federalisation an \"infection\" that he hinted was being forced on the country by foreign powers, apparently referring to Russia.\n \n \"When Ukraine united, they came at us with aggression, with war, trying to establish federalisation with iron and blood. I won't let that happen; the Ukrainian people won't let that happen,\" he told the commission.\n \n Poroshenko has said 90% of Ukrainians supported a unitary government.\n \n The adoption of a new constitution by the end of 2015 is one of the stipulations of the Minsk peace plan brokered in February by the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine. Decentralisation will be a key part of constitutional reform, but it remains unclear what form it will take.\n \n Volodymyr Groysman, chairman of the constitutional reform commission, said planning for decentralisation would begin at the next meeting on 15 April, which would also discuss human rights and judicial reforms.\n \n Advertisement\n \n Vadim Karasyov, a political analyst from Kiev, said that, the idea of federalisation was unpopular and a referendum was likely to fail. Nonetheless, the constitutional reform process would meet France and Germany's demands that Ukraine give greater autonomy to eastern regions, he said.\n \n \"I think we will be talking about the decentralisation of Ukraine within a unitary government, and Donbass will be able to hope only for special status allowing local self-government according to Ukrainian law,\" he said, referring to a historical name for Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n \n Poroshenko also said on Monday that Ukrainian would remain the only official state language, arguing that three-quarters of the population supported this. Greater official recognition of the Russian language has been a rebel demand. Last spring, Ukraine's parliament attempted to repeal a law that recognises Russian as a second official language in regions with significant Russian-speaking populations, but the acting president refused to sign the repeal.\n \n Meanwhile, Ukraine's defence ministry announced that ultranationalist MP Dmytro Yarosh was to become an aide to military chief Viktor Muzhenko and that his Right Sector fighting group would be integrated into the armed forces.\n \n The news was widely reported in Russia, where Yarosh has been criticised for his radical stances and anti-Russian statements. In February, Yarosh said in a post on Facebook that his forces would continue to fight the enemy despite the ceasefire agreed in Minsk as part of the peace plan. Rebels in eastern Ukraine have accused Right Sector of atrocities against Russian speakers.\n \n Karasyov called the appointment honorary and said it was part of an ongoing campaign to put an end to the \"private armies\" that had sprung up over the past year to help the ill-prepared Ukrainian military put down the separatist conflict. Last month, Ihor Kolomoisky, who bankrolled pro-Kiev volunteer battalions in eastern Ukraine, was removed from his post of governor of Dnipropetrovsk.\n \n \"Ukraine doesn't need scandals and it doesn't really need Yarosh,\" Karasyov said. \"This is an honourable capitulation for him and his big military goals. He will remain an MP and an aide but he won't significantly affect the policy of the defence department.\"\n \n Anton Geraschenko, an advisor in the interior ministry, said Yarosh could keep working on military initiatives. \"I see that he's bored in the [parliament], plus he's now been seriously wounded in battle, and I would love to create a volunteer defence union of Ukraine with Dmytro Yarosh like in the Estonian, Finnish and Swiss systems,\" he said.",

There is speculation that American shale oil becomes unprofitable at around $80 a barrel, which is not much lower than the current price. So it seems to me OPEC may try to keep production up, especially as we head into winter, hoping low prices will hurt American production. And it also seems that many OPEC countries would be reluctant to follow Iran.",
