Even if the PSB fails to maintain the lead for second place, its enough to shake up PT's lead. \n \n http://online.wsj.com/articles/silva-has-strong-shot-at-brazils-presidency-poll-1408372505\n \n Moreover, the 2010 election went to a runoff, as did the 2006 and 2002.

        "North Korea is a joke, often making ludicrous claims about their capabilities. However, they do have missiles and rockets of a sort, though they seem rather less reliable than those in use by other countries. But North Korea is a real wildcard. Their actions sometimes defy logic. It's hard to say whether South Korean deployment of THAAD would make North Korea more likely to test a launch, as a show of bravado, or less likely due to the fear of failure, but I'm leaning slightly toward more likely.\n \n Note that the resolution criteria for the question define \"long-range\" as capable of reaching the continental United States, Alaska, or Hawaii. However, in addition to actual missile tests, they also include launches of rockets for launching satellites, since anything reaching orbit is deemed capable of reaching around the world. Since their 2012 satellite tests were deemed by many countries to violate a ban on North Korean ballistic missile tests, this is a reasonable stance. This makes the event somewhat more likely than it might be otherwise.\n \n Among North Korea's several missile tests, only one, the one in 2006, was of a missile meeting the resolution criteria.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_missile_tests\n \n They have also had 4 satellite launches which qualify, in 1998, 2009, and two in 2012.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwangmy%C5%8Fngs%C5%8Fng-3_Unit_2\n And see the links at the end of this article for other satellite launches.\n \n Since they have had a qualifying launch in one out of every three years in recent times, I'm putting this chance at about 1/3, slightly more likely due to not having any in the last year and a half.",
        "From other forecasts concerning North Korea I have the impression that it has deep internal problems which must be solved. It is also conspicous that Kim Jong Un has not escalated the situation further and reinstated the Kaesong complex.\n In his situation he needs help from outside, so careful advances to other countries are to be expected.\n \n From that I conclude that he will meet a head of state, most likely China's president. But knowing that Kim Jong Un is a recluse, it can lead to an unreported secret meeting.\n \n Given that not much known is about this chance, it expect wildly differing estimates from other players, centering about 50%.",

One obvious endorsement of his chances is that he is calling for the election, implying he think his chances are very good.\n \n The PM position will be won through building coalitions and although Netanyahu's coalition may change, it is hard to see an entirely different coalition replace him. He's got everything from the center-right locked up and his extreme right would have to make a coalition with the center-left in order to oust him. This seems unlikely. There is a possibility that his coalition wins, but selects a different PM. Possible, but would be abnormal.\n \n There have been recent changes in election law that raises the threshold to enter the Knesset.

Further, there continues to be widespread violence undermining social and political stability, much of it rooted in the inexperience of the nominally governing General National Council.  While an election possibly could occur with the 90 day window set forth inthe resolution,  its credibility and integrity will be severely undermined unless the minority and women's grievances can be addressed.  But the call of the quesiton is whether the elections are \"completed\" by election of 2/3 of the 60 seats.

        "IS has successful taken over considerable swathes of territory across Syria and Iraq, and that operational action of taking over territory is part of it's the main part of their overall strategy to create an Islamic state. However, it will not attempt the same in the short with other countries such as Jordan, even less the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE that are farther away from their strongholds. This is because their operational capabilities are not that significant, and have also suffered strains from the US-led campaign against it in Iraq and Syria. So for the moment, the only thing they could do to \"punish\" those \"infidel\" states is to plan terrorist attacks inside those countries. This is relatively cheaper to do and easier to carry out, and would be more likely to occur in the next months.\n \n For that, I'm giving a high estimate of 75% and will adjust depending on new developments. \n \n * Comparison classes inform probability estimates (POMP)\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Expansion from Syria to Iraq: IS quickly expanded in eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq, however that expansion was mainly due to weak governance in those two countries; conquering land in Jordan and the other countries that support the US-led campaign is much more challenging, and will not be attempted right now.

IS: main intention is to create an Islamic state; it focused on Syria and Iraq but has vowed to expand beyond to Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine; its capabilities do not seem large enough to conquer those territories, like it's done in Syria and Iraq, but it can still engage in attacks. \n b. Bahrain: has participated in air strikes against IS in Syria; hosts American bases\n c. Qatar: Believed to have finance terrorism; hosts American bases in its territory; might be targeted if IS see's Bahrain's actions as a major act of betrayal (speculation); \n d. Jordan: most outspoken on their support; participated in airstrikes; will commit ground forces; provides intelligence\n e. UAE: launched airstrikes in Syria\n f. Saudi Arabia: Has been threatened by IS, which blames the Saudis for letting Western attacks; its hosting US training of Syrian opposition, so that could be perceived as a major act of betrayal (similar to AQ's reasoning to target the US, its bases on Arab lands following first gulf war)\n i. Train and equip Syrian opposition forces to fight IS in Syria; $500 in humanitarian aid\n g. Turkey: allowed foreign troops to launch attacks from Turkey; authorized to use military force against IS \n h. Kurds in Iraq: fiercely fighting IS in Iraq and across the border in Syria; willing to commit more forces to fight IS beyond Kurdish territory if done within a broad international coalition and strategy\n i. US & NATO: have led the attack on IS strongholds, but made sure other countries joined, especially those in the regional with more to lose.

It is widely expected that a restructuring will occur and that the haircut will be substantially higher than agreed in the July deal.\n\n\n\nThere is considerable pressure to clarify the size of the haircut (which would enhance the credibility of the ongoing bank recapitalization efforts) and to demonstrate that Greece will have a sustainable debt trajectory when the next tranche of funding is released in early November, as well as delivering some debt relief to Greece as compensation for the very painful reforms it's undertaking. The troika has already acknowledged that the recession will be deeper than anticipated.\n\n\n\nThus, I think it is highly likely that a modified deal will be announced ahead of the G20 meeting. However it's not clear that a distressed exchange actually needs to occur by 30 November: the 8bn aid tranche will easily cover 3.6bn of debt maturities in November (vs an additional 6.86bn in December). Given the desirability of recapitalizing banks before completing the debt exchange, I think it's more likely that the restructuring will occur in December or later.\n\n\n\nGiven the high likelihood that the November funding tranche will be disbursed, I think there's a negligible probability that Greece will miss an interest or principal payment in the meantime.",

        "Nigeria's presidential election is to be held on 14 Feb 2015 per\n http://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/158/\n \n Judging by the following, Jonathan's advantage as the incumbent seems big, so I think .40 is conservative.\n \n 10/16 The only strongly contradictory report I found, FTA:\n General Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress would crush the incumbent, President Goodluck Jonathan, in a head-to-head contest by a whopping margin of 78% to 22, an unscientific online survey indicates.\n http://saharareporters.com/2014/10/16/buhari-crushes-goodluck-jonathan-early-2015-independent-survey\n \n Two mildly contradictory demographic breakdowns:\n FTA:\n Nigeria is religiously diverse society, with Islam and Christianity being the most widely professed religions. According to recent estimates, 50.4% of Nigeria's population adheres to Islam (mainly Sunni). Christianity is practiced by 48.2% of the population (15% Protestant, 13.7% Catholic, 19.6% other Christian).\n Religion in Nigeria - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nigeria\n FTA:\n Religious affiliation in Nigeria is strongly related to ethnicity, with rather distinct regional divisions between ethnic groups. The northern states,  dominated by the Hausa and Fulani groups, are predominantly Muslim while the southern ethnic groups have a large number of Christians. In the southwest, there is no predominant religion. The Yoruba tribe, which is the majority ethnic group in the southwest, practice Christianity, Muslim, and/or the traditional Yoruba religion, which centers on the belief in one supreme god and several lesser deities.\n    Overall statistics indicate that about 50% of the population are Muslim, with a majority practicing the Sunni branch of the faith. About 40% are Christian and about 10% practice traditional African religions or no religion at all.\n http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Nigeria-RELIGIONS.html\n \n Strongly confirming report, FTA:\n    Not many presidents could survive three multi-billion dollar government oil corruption scandals and a wave of cold-blooded killings and kidnappings of civilians by Islamist militants still holding hundreds of schoolgirls after six months.\n    Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan has not only survived, he will seek reelection in February stronger than ever, after five years in a job no one expected him to get.\n    Jonathan's support base within the ruling party is now unchallenged, a rare feat for the often fractious People's Democratic Party (PDP), while the main opposition APC coalition is split between two contestants for the presidency.\n    ...\n    Meanwhile, apart from the security challenges, his government also has been beset by corruption allegations.\n    ...\n    Jonathan, a Christian southerner, was an accidental president, taking over in 2009 after President Umaru Yar'adua, a Muslim from the north, died from illness.\n    When Jonathan was elected to his own term in 2011, many in the north resented his decision to run, believing he had torn up an unwritten rule that power should rotate between mainly Muslim north and mainly Christian south every two terms.\n    Former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, who lost to Jonathan in 2011, and defected PDP ex-vice president Atiku Abubakar are vying for the opposition APC ticket. Both launched bids in the past month, focusing on security and graft.\n    Roddy Barclay, senior Africa analyst at Control Risks, a political risk consultancy, sees two \"principle factors for Jonathan's robust position in spite of the scandals and failings which have rocked his government\".\n    \"Firstly, the primacy of money and patronage in determining electoral outcomes in Nigeria,\" means an incumbent gets a huge advantage, and second, \"the opposition lacks steadfast unity\".\n    That marks a big change from less than a year ago. In December it was the PDP that was in crisis. Thirty seven lawmakers defected to the APC that month, demolishing the PDP's lower house majority. Rotimi Amaechi, powerful governor of the oil hub state of Rivers, also defected.\n    The same month, Jonathan's mentor and PDP Godfather, ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo, wrote a scathing letter saying it would be \"fatally morally flawed\" for Jonathan to seek re-election in 2015 because of corruption under his rule. Jonathan called the intervention \"unjustifiable and indecorous\".\n    Ten months on and the APC has failed to capitalize. It has not agreed on a presidential candidate and several disillusioned APC figures have flipped to the PDP, underscoring the fluid nature of Nigerian party politics.\n    They include popular two-term ex-governor of Kano state Ibrahim Shakarau, a Buhari rival, and former anti-corruption chief Nuhu Ribadu, denying the APC a strong anti-graft platform, although Buhari still has strong anti-corruption credentials.\n    ...\n    In June, the APC then lost a governorship election in southwestern Ekiti state to the ruling party.\n    ...\n    On Dec 2, the dynamic could shift when the party picks its candidate. Buhari earned a reputation for cracking down on corruption during his time in power in 1983-85, and most Nigerians agree he did not use the post to enrich himself, but it is not clear whether he would win votes from APC supporters in the south.\n    ...\n    The power sector is under improvement, but that may not draw votes since the supply in one of the world's most electricity-starved countries has fallen in the short term.\n    Many voters are likely to see the Boko Haram insurgency, which only affects the remote northeast apart from occasional bomb attacks in the capital or other cities, as just one problem in their large, diverse country.\n    \"Expectations in the electorate are fairly modest and they are hugely disenfranchised, despite ... years of civilian rule,\" said Antony Goldman, head of Nigeria-focused PM Consulting.\n    \"You don't need to be popular or successful in conventional terms to win an election in Nigeria,\" he said, although he added that no president had managed to stay popular after four years in office, and the APC had yet to present a clear alternative.\n    ...\n    Jonathan's assumed decision to run has widened a divide between elites in Nigeria's south and north because of a feeling in the north that it is still their \"turn\" to rule.\n    That makes violence likely, especially if the poll is close. In 2011, more than 800 were killed and 65,000 displaced in three days of violence after Jonathan beat Buhari in the poll.\n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/27/us-nigeria-jonathan-idUSKBN0IG1E220141027\n ",

Russia reportedly offered the Antey-2500 system in 2013 but was rebuffed (http://missilethreat.com/putin-to-offer-advanced-antimissiles-to-soothe-irans-s-300-grudge-report/, http://en.trend.az/iran/2220525.html)\n \n A deal would appeal to Russia on a number of levels, strengthening ties to countries not aligned to the sanctions against it, generating arms export revenue, putting the original S-300 lawsuit to rest and satisfying Iran's need for weapons systems it is trying to develop a domestic capability to build.\n \n Whether a move to purchase this system would help or hinder Iran's negotiations with the P5+1 is hard to predict; however an announcement before the current talks deadline would seem unlikely.

        "I don't think it's particularly likely. As Nienna and Fairplay stated, the dominant producer in OPEC is Saudi Arabia, who need only 90$/barrel prices to balance their budget. While this is above the current price, OPEC is realizing that its price-setting powers are diminishing as Chinese demand slumps and more production comes online from Russia, Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The Saudis are more concerned with fighting for market share at this point, and are likely willing to accept lower prices for the time being to ensure their continued exports dominance when prices rise again.\n \n A couple decades ago, we very well might have seen an output cut. Were OPEC to cut now, however, and raise global oil prices, they would also incentivize increased exploration and production in newly accessible deposits and further increase supply and decrease their market share. \n \n Thought this WSJ blog post did a good job summing up: http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/10/17/opecs-not-so-slick-on-oil-prices-now/.

Last month it produced 30.7 million barrels in total. However, the International Energy Agency forecasts demand for OPEC oil will be some 1.4 million barrels a day lower next year, at 29.3 million barrels a day.\n The Paris-based energy watchdog also expects non-OPEC production to rise by 1.2 million barrels a day in 2015. In other words, even if OPEC did agree to a large cut to balance the market, it would only be making room for competing oil volumes.\"",

Further, the U.S. is still advocating Iraq's integrity.\n \n \"The Kurds' top priority is now to defeat ISIL and secure their existence. Hence their independence project will be in cold storage for a while.\"\n \n In addition, today Arbil needs Baghdad and the regional powers as never before. Barzani's chief of staff, Fuad Hussein, who I had interviewed one month ago, made this claim. He said they need to cooperate with Baghdad, Turkey and Iran in their fight against ISIL and hence would not take any step without their consent. It is more than obvious that under the current circumstances, Turkey and Iran would not give them the green light to independence.\n \n Moreover, Arbil could not do anything \"despite the U.S.\" If it wants to be independent, it first needs international recognition which means: American recognition.\n Further, Iran does not want independence neither does Turkey. \n Thus, though the Kurds want it, I think January 2015 is not likely because of these latest developments. \n \n \n ",

However, the militants went on to drive the Iraqi and peshmerga forces out Mosul, thus showing that they pose a threat to Kurds.  \n \n America and Britain do not support an independent Kurdistan.

If China will publicly stress the importance of good governance as an essential component of making the development process work, the AIIB has a chance of being successful, and may work well in generating significantly more financial resources for the region. If not, the AIIB could become an embarrassment for China's government, and, in the end, its own commercial interests. With Xi Jinping's personal endorsement and credibility on the line, there is a better chance that it will succeed, than not. The proof will be in the pudding.\" \n \n We have to ask what the political drivers for the NDB. China provides leadership for the AIIB.

        "Overall low likelihood but will watch the ECB's March announcement very closely.   Based on comments from the head of the ECB (\"Super\" Mario Draghi and Liikanen) in these articles, the ECB is linking non-conventional monetary policy to the level of inflation, and not what happens in the US with tapering.  MY forecast is therefore a function of i) is there a visible threat of deflation, and if so, ii) which non-conventional monetary policy to pursue. Neither Draghi nor Liikanen view deflation as a problem yet, and we only have one more ECB meeting during the survey period, so I will say there's only a 20% chance of them announcing extraordinary measures in the March meeting.  if so, the question is what measure will they take. I think there are three broad options - a) negative deposit rates, b) another burst of long-term bank financing (like the LTRO that they did in 2011) or c) quantitative easing (QE).  I'll say a 50% chance of them choosing negative interest rates as it avoids the ineffectiveness concerns with b and political/legal issues with getting Germany to sign up to QE.   http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/business/international/european-central-bank-holds-interest-rate-at-0-25.html?_r=0 http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/11/ecb-liikanen-deflation-idUSL5N0LG2AP20140211 ",

Starting to affect resource sector (e.g. liquiefied nat. gas project need American parts), source of his regime's power.

        "As seen by the downing on the Malaysian Airliner and the recent mortar attack on a refugee bus, the situation in east Ukraine is dynamic with a lot a variability for wildcards to pop up and change the equation.  \n \n Looking at the players Putin has been aggressively pushing his agenda of creating termoral in the region to keep Ukrainian on it's toes and prevent anymore ingratiation with west (read: NATO). Nor does Putin have motivation to back down with his approval rates the highest in years according to Gallup (http://www.gallup.com/poll/173597/russian-approval-putin-soars-highest-level-years.aspx) and support from Russian Oligarchs. Despite this aggressive posturing, he has toned down his rhetoric in the past couple of days and will be meeting with the Ukraine Prime Mister select for the first time with in the next couple weeks. Russian has every reason to settle this peacefully as their economy has started to slow and companies are starting to feel the sanctions bit (their state controlled oil company just requested a 40billion dollar loan to help offset sanctions) http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/hurt-putin-hurt\n \n The Ukraine government has every reason to avoid a confrontation with Russia (read: russian would hand them their asses in a open conflict see the Odessa/Georgian conflict) and the lack of military support they'd receive from the West (see above statements). \n \n Another factor is the lack of reliable information coming from the conflict. I think even if there was a border skirmish between Russian/Ukraine the information coming out might not be enough to meet the standards of confrontation set by the Project. In fact there's a good chance this confrontation already happened when Ukraine shelled and destroyed artilery units Russian in Ukraine. This destruction didn't meet the definition below because the reports couldn't not substantiated and Russian has denied involvement.\n \n Because of this lack of information & motivation factors pushing the actors to settle this without conflict, I'm setting this as unlikely to happen. \n ",

If it falls, they will likely fall, too.  I consider Al Shabab politically incompetent, but it's hard to judge their current military strength.  They still have several thousand fighters and may have spared the best for their last stand.  Kismayo isn't particularly large, but not very accessible for armored units.  The attackers would have to use significant numbers of ground troops to clear and hold the densely populated areas that cannot be easily reached by tanks.  The attackers apparently have enough troops, but I'm not sure what they will do when their casualties mount significantly, which is likely if Al Shabab stands their ground.  The latter have clearly shown that they are willing to hold the inhabitants hostage and use them as human shields.  This will make it much harder for the attackers to advance.  If Al Shabab plays it smart, they might leverage the disagreement among their attackers.

        "Dec. 4, 2013 3:58 a.m. ET TOKYO - Japan, South Korea and China have agreed to form a network to quickly exchange information in a nuclear emergency such as the Fukushima-Daiichi accident in 2011, Japanese and Korean officials said on Wednesday.  In addition to Japan's NRA, officials from South Korea's Nuclear Safety and Security Commission and China's National Nuclear Security Administration signed the agreement, according to documents on the pact distributed by the Japanese regulator.  Under the agreement, each country's regulators must quickly provide information of nuclear accident to its counterparts in the other two countries by both email and phone. All accidents deemed at or above Level 2 on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale as well as Level 1 accidents of an interest to the public are subject to such notification.  The three countries will immediately set up special email accounts for the information exchange, and may add video-conference capabilities in the future, the agreement said.  In addition to sharing accident information, the three countries will exchange regular information, such as on safety plans.  \"Both Korea and Japan were very active from the early stage of talks to reach an agreement,\" said Lee Jae-sung, director general of South Korea's Nuclear Safety and Security Commission. Mr. Lee said the three countries agreed information on the military use of nuclear power by China wouldn't be shared with the other two. He called the agreement \"unprecedented.\"  The agreement comes despite territorial tensions in the region that have increased in recent weeks after China declared an air-defense identification zone, or ADIZ, that includes areas over islands claimed by both China and Japan, and as top-level meetings between Beijing and Tokyo remain indefinitely on hold. As civil aviation authorities in the three countries squabble over airlines' obligations in response to China's ADIZ, the nuclear agreement illustrates the need for continuing cooperation as economic and other interests in the region become increasingly intertwined.

        "This is one of the most esoteric questions I have seen since the start of GJP. VSTOXX is a kind of \"volatility index\" measuring the variance in prices of stock options in the 50 European blue-chip stocks in the EURO STOXX 50 index. So this is, in a sense, two levels removed from the actual trading prices of the stocks. Presumably this index would increase when there was a lot of uncertainty in the markets, or when people were expecting large swings. But there are too many possible events, especially over the long time scale, to sensibly be able to predict this from actual causes. I think only a base-rate prediction is possible here.\n \n The chart (on the More Info site) shows that it has only reached the level of 23 twice this year, once for two days in early February and once for a single day in March. It also closed at this level one day last October, and two other times that year. If we go back further, in 2011 it reached the low 50s and was above 23 for an extended period. But the behavior since the start of 2013 looks most consistent, and also the calmest and lowest of values of this index on record. It's been just over 6 months since the last close above 23, but every period of 223 days since the start of 2013 has had a close over 23, and the time before that was even more volatile, so the base rate is 100%.\n \n I'm not actually going above 80% because it's just too random a thing to rely on. Later, assuming it does not reach this level and close early, I may reduce this score if it seems like it is staying far from 23 (or increase it if it seems more likely to hit it).",

So there is history for this sort of annexation stuff. We know there is sympathy for annexation in eastern Ukraine. \n \n \"Cautious\" or not, Putin may still annex eastern Ukraine\n - http://bit.ly/YsVduK\n \n Putin's next move will be in part dictated by whether he expects to be received as a savior or an interloper in eastern Ukraine. If the former, he is likelier to absorb the two regions. But even if it's the latter, he may do it anyway.\n *************************************\n \n Given western sanctions on Russia and Putin\u00c2\u00b4s exceptionally aggressive behavior, I think it is more likely that he will annex eastern Ukraine than not. That would be one form of a push-back against the West. Russian already grabbed an intelligence officer from Estonia as a message to the West. Also Putin mentioned Russia\u00c2\u00b4s nuclear capabilities. A general mentioned a preemptive nuclear strike on NATO and the US under certain circumstances. Russian bombers just executed a nuclear cruise missile strike (exercise) from the Atlantic. And Russia has now labeled NATO as its number one threat.\n \n Another way to look at this forecast is how I want to be wrong. Do I want to be wrong because I was too aggressive, or not aggressive enough? In my mind I cannot accept being wrong because I was not aggressive enough. This is especially true given Putin\u00c2\u00b4s fairly rapid invasion of eastern Ukraine with \"little green men.\" Putin consistently shows a lot of aggressiveness.

On Up days, it closed 0.856% higher, on Down days, 0.846% lower.  \n \n The simulator works such that for each trading day it picks whether the Index will go up or down, with a 52% chance of going up.

The politics reflected this: It was always a balancing act to fulfill both desires. After the Maidan revolution the balance moved completely to the West and therefore the growing tension and requests for separation in the eastern part is understandable.\n \n Russian view:\n Russia gets more and more the impression that it is painted as evil independent of what they do. The illegal deposition of the Ukrainian president and the participation of the violent and extremist Swoboda party is largely ignored in the Western media. That Ukraine is not able to pay their outstanding gas debts: ignored. The shots on the Maidan place was very likely done by Swoboda activists which Nuland in her \"Fuck the EU\" phone call mentioned. The shot down of flight MH-17 by a SAM missile was entirely blamed on the separatists while the exact cause and perpetrator is still unknown.\n Russia is sanctioned for...what exactly ?

They all seem more interested to get Ukraine ready for joining the West. As the continued conflict threaten to divide the Ukraine (which would be further de-facto state like Transnistria, Abchazia and South Ossetia longing for Russian support) they all seem interested to build up a threat scenario to Russia to hamper Russian intervention in Ukraine, allowing a very bloody fight in the eastern part of Ukraine to suppress the independence streak as fast as possible.\n \n Analysis: Given that the tensions have so far only worsened between the West and Russia, I predict that a lethal confrontation will occur.\n ",

Not quite sure my reasoning is correct, but while I figure it out and await my friends' response I may as well share here.\n \n Volatility over one year is indeed 17.5%. However over a 69 day period (calculated this yesterday, using 49 trading days vs 252 total for a year) one sigma is 7.7%. That would make a drop from 1286 to 1200 a 0.86 sigma event, which Z-tables tell me sits 30% below mean. Add to that the 50% above mean (=closes above 1286) and this would indicate there is an 80% chance that the TOPIX will NOT close below 1200. All of this assumes, of course, that a market index follows a random walk from any given point, which for this short time period I think is reasonable. Over very long periods, indices tend to drift upwards, so the volatility is not quite symmetrical.\n \n What stumps me at this point, and what I asked my friend about, is whether it makes a difference that the index may drop below 1200 *on any given day* between now and close, i.e. it's not just one sample on 30 October. For now, I'll start with 20% and then adjust in the next couple of days. \n \n But seems to me we need to investigate our consensus, market fluctuations happen but moves of 6-7% over about 2 months are rarer than 1 in 2 (especially because it has to be a move down, such a move up doesn't count).\n \n Help me, people, if I am missing something fundamental please point out!",

While these are the same people who unilaterally delayed the election in the first place, the opposition has latched onto this guaranteed and threatened judicial action if the election is pushed back again (1). The international community, too, has put pressure on the Nigerian government to hold relatively free and fair elections soon. Further delays could threaten sanctions, or at the very least, diplomatic pushback. While few Nigerians believe that the elections will be clean, they still support having them (2). This leads to a high level of pressure on the national government to allow the vote to occur, even if they fear they will lose. \n \n This can be adjusted as we neat the date - the government won't cancel polling the day of for fear of major civil unrest and protests.

Unfortunately, Assad could see goading Turkey into triggering just such an Armageddon as an attractive way to end the ongoing blame for his country's catastrophe, so there's some chance he'll manage it.

        "I was following Wingender's reasoning until I understood that WTI is not exported, and reviewed the Obama administration's policy toward this US production. \n \n OVX measures volatility uniquely for the US West Texas Intermediate oil, not Brent Crude, not OPEC petroleum. As there is a 41 year-old US ban on exporting crude, the WTI supply and pricing fluctuate with some independence from global market, though of course there is convergence. The index ties to price deviations from the mean daily price of WTI; if the price moves a lot, up or down, the OVX rises. If the price changes little, the OVX falls.\n \n Historic models of cycles suggest that low oil prices will have to rise (though analysts predict lower prices this week for Brent Crude, OPEC) and late Spring would be, seasonally, a likely period for that.\n \n As always, the oil trade is affected by political disturbances, though it has remained surprisingly static through turbulence in Ukraine and the Middle East this year.  \n \n Reading through the news feed, I find that the investors refer to oil generally as being \"range-bound,\" not moving far from its current pricing. OVX http://www.cboe.com/micro/oilvix/introduction.aspx has not traded at or above 25.0 in more than 1 year, and has traded above its 50-Day Moving Average for most of the tracings since July. \n Until there is a shift in US energy policy, I do not see big gains, nor losses, likely for WTI pricing.

        "I'll state going in that this is a slightly trickier question for me to call, because I'd  prefer the result it describes over any other one, but I'll try and leave my personal bias at the door.\n \n This election is highly unusual in that the Liberal Democrats, a current coalition partner and the party who has most often swept up protest votes in the past, is trailing far behind in the polls.  Local constituency polls (like the ones here: http://lordashcroftpolls.com/constituency-polls/) suggest that they are likely to lose a lot of seats.\n \n Two new protest parties have risen to fill the gap: the Greens (who have been around forever, but have only recently started making big gains in the polls) and UKIP, who have also been around for a long time but who have seen slow and steady growth in their polling.  (The Greens have a single MP, elected in 2010; UKIP have 2, both defectors from the Conservatives who were subsequently reelected as UKIP MPs).\n \n The big question, as Ella highlights, is how the national polls will translate into changes at a local level.  Again, local polling is helpful, but to my mind there are three key personal / party issues that will decide the election for voters, and which may not be showing up in the polls:\n \n 1) Protest vs. Government: Protest parties invariably do better in the polls than they do when people are actually making a choice that will affect who governs them.  (As an example, the Lib Dems polled 4-5% lower, nationally, than the polls suggested they would beforehand - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010#2010).  Actually making a choice on polling day forces people to think harder about what they want and what they think would be best for the country - and Conservative slogans like, \"Vote UKIP, get Labour\" may have an impact here.\n \n 2) Tory Toxicity: Despite the efforts of some of the Conservative leadership over the past 10 years, the Tories are still seen by many as a toxic brand - The Nasty Party.  Uncaring and greedy, they will grind the faces of the poor into the dirt - that sort of thing.  Consequently, many people are still reluctant to admit voting for them - even when they may believe that they are the best choice for the country.  This is one of the potential explanations for the result of the 1992 General Election, where Labour held a led all the way to polling day, but then lost to the Conservatives.\n \n 3) A Suitable Executive: Brits vote for MPs, but almost everyone does so with an eye on who would assume the Executive powers of the country - in particular who would become the Prime Minister.  David Cameron continues to out-poll other party leaders on the question, \"Who would make the best Prime Minister?\" http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/leaders, while Ed Milliband is portrayed by the media in a very unfavourable light (search for Milliband Bacon Sandwich for examples) \n \n Potentially trumping all of these is the economy.  The Tories are still seen as the best economic managers, and the UK economy is showing promising signs of recovery.  Assuming that this recovery is sustained through to the election, then a reputation for economic competence may also drive a \"hold your nose and vote Tory\" attitude. \n \n Finally (and with apologies for the long answer), I'll try and offset some of my likely bias with a detailed analysis by a Conservative-supporting UK political analyst.  Based on local polling, plus his own knowledge of the lie of the land, he's predicting a very messy result - with Labour holding the most seats.  I think (perhaps wishfully) that he's interpreting the polls too rigidly, but I may well be wrong! http://www.iaindale.com/posts/2015/01/18/general-election-predictions-the-final-results-we-re-heading-for-a-three-party-coalition-or-a-second-election  \n \n \n (First prediction of 2015 - hopefully more to come this week!)",

        "Curfews may come and go, but a \"state of emergency\" will remain, at least in partial form.  First, once a state of emergency has been declared, one has to overcome inertia of that new status quo.  Any attack or terroristic incident would push towards extending the state of emergency.  Second, as part of securing Sinai near the Gaza Strip, buildings were razed, imploded, and otherwise destroyed.  Those measures do not seem to have been taken as part of a short-term, temporary state of emergency. I would expect the state of emergency to remain at least to the extent that new construction cannot be erected in place of the destroyed buildings.  The Egyptian government will likely wish to keep that area clear to discourage tunnels from being reconstructed and used.\n \n The groups opposed to the state of emergency are not in a very good position of power.  They are not the ruling party.  They admit that protesting would result in bloodshed (which would be used to justify keeping a state of emergency in effect).  Instead of protesting, they intend to go on strike.  Strikes are not going to be effective because they will not be allowed by the Egyptian government to be effective.  In other words, strikes can go on for so long as they do not affect the economy of Egypt.  If they begin to cause effects undesired by Egypt, then strike-busting measures will be implemented - either replacement labor or military/police action.  If the latter, bloodshed will occur and the state of emergency will be justified yet again.\n \n So, I believe a state of emergency in some form will remain so long as terroristic threats remain.

        "At least for now, Ebola has not been contained. It has spread quickly through West Africa and a case has already been registered in the US. There are strong links between Western African countries and European countries such as France and the UK (aid workers, people with family links...). Also, due to high air travel between Europe and West Africa (which has yet to be limited), it's only a matter of time before someone with Ebola reaches Europe. Reports by epidemiologists forecast that by end October, an Ebola case is likely to be registered in Europe, most likely in France, the UK, or Belgium.

Severity of disease (proportion of people that contract disease AND die): Ebola - fatality rate of 70-90%\n - So Ebola is high on severity, but very low on transmission. But there's a potential problem: incubation periods for Ebola are 2-21 days, so someone with the virus could inadvertently slip through airport security and later become symptomatic.\n \n * Mathematical and statistical models can help.\n - Recent scientific projections:\n http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/135600/1/roadmapsitrep_1Oct2014_eng.pdf?ua=1\n \n * Know the power players, their goals, and motivation to prevail on an issue\n - WHO: main role is to coordinate emergency response efforts by states; highly politicized agency; criticized for not being present during the beginning stage of the outbreak; WHO has answered back that Ebola spread was due mostly by poor health systems and bad health practices in Western African countries; WHO is no longer coordinating these efforts, as it has been replaced by a special UN mission  \n - US: has sent soldiers (3-4k) to West Africa to help contain the outbreak (e.g. building treatment centers and train healthcare workers) \n - EU: sending humanitarian experts, mobile labs, and other assistance to help reinforce West African response capabilities and health care systems; has not yet limited air traffic\n - Countries sending aid: health workers are getting infected and killed more than others (fatality rate of 57% for aid workers vs. 47% for overall cases).

North Korea, early during the Obama administration, built a uranium enrichment facility that went undetected until the North showed it off to a visiting professor from Stanford.  \"'The lesson from this history is that we found these at the last moment, if we found them at all,' said Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A. expert on terrorism and nuclear proliferation who is now at the Brookings Institution.  \"...The report implicitly called into question whether administration officials should be so confident that they would detect if Iran ever violated the nuclear accord that began this week.\"  So cheating IS possible and would blow up the whole interim agreement.   And a sanctions bill passed through Congress could also threaten the deal (though the latest information is that the sanctions bill being considered has stalled short of the two thirds veto-proof majority in the Senate). But still, such a bill could get passed with a veto-proof majority - it's possible. And then Iran might void the deal and start installing centrifuges again.

        "The Euro has been on a downward slide for the better part of a year[1].  The dollar exchange rate is down about 17% from a year ago.  With the uncertainty facing the Euro, particularly surrounding the possibility of a Greek default and/or exit from the Euro[2].  At the same time, the dollar has been strengthening due to speculation that a rise in interest rates is on the horizon[3]. Therefore, it seems likely that the slide in the EUR:USD rate will continue.  Let's say it's a bit slower than the past year, maybe -15%/yr.  The volatility in the exchange rate is easy to find, thanks to this sort of thing being closely followed by FX traders.  It's 6.2%/yr [4].  Putting these into a barrier probabilities calculator [5] (one of these days I'll get around to looking up that formula and programming it myself), and you get probability of a closing price below 1.10 of 70.6% between now and the deadline 77 days hence.  \n \n The assumed long-term rate of decline matters a lot to the probability you get.  Change it to -10%/yr, and you get a probability of just 55.8%; therefore, anything that would stabilize the Euro's decline, even a little bit, will induce a major revision to the forecast.  The most obvious candidate is the upcoming meeting of the Euro-zone finance ministers.  An agreement there would make hitting the $1.10 target much less likely.  However, many observers think an agreement is unlikely in this round of talks [6], which is why I'm going with the higher estimate for now.\n \n [1] https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=Linear&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1423679053306&chddm=359060&q=CURRENCY:EURUSD&ntsp=0&ei=QZ7bVIjlFYaU9AbPmoG4DA\n [2] http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/11/us-markets-forex-idUSKBN0LE2W520150211\n [3] http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/10/us-markets-forex-idUSKBN0LD2I220150210\n [4] http://www.ratesfx.com/predictions/pred-usd.html\n [5] http://www.hoadley.net/options/barrierprobs.aspx\n [6] http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/11/markets-global-idUSL5N0VL24V20150211",

        "Rationale 1:  There are tremendous liquidity problems in the real economy due to the European Commission, Central Bank and IMF refusing to play ball with the new government.  The key issue is that all the funds that went to the bank re-capitalization are now at risk given the slow but clear draining of bank deposits.  This is the second time in 3 years that they see this happening.  Every time it happens it costs a lot of money to save the banks and in the real economy setting everything back by months if not years.  So, self preservation by Greece leads to a YES along with EU's recognition that they are likely to waste more money if they don't spend it now. \n \n Rationale 2:  There is tremendous pressure within SYRIZA.  The \"left wing\" rationale has been reflected in the writings of John Milios and Dimitri Sotiropoulos.  It influenced SYRIZA's approach to date.

On the other side: the constitution is only the first step - a parliament must be selected, president elected, and reforms continued - a distraction from negotiations. External security forces are in place, making it easier to keep fighting than to risk negotiations, especially since al Qaeda/al-Shabaab has remained very active.",

If Iraq breaks apart as a country, there will be.\n \n Facts:\n - The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) approved a law for an\n    independent electoral commission.\n - The commission must be set up within 90 days of the law passing (i.e., late \n   October 2014).\n \n Assumptions:\n - The KRG can have a voting mechanism/structure/process in place to hold a \n    referendum by late December.\n - The KRG would hold a referendum without first conducting a census.\n \n Reasons for no independence vote:\n \n The KRG is pursuing a two-track policy: bargaining to stay part of Iraq on more advantageous terms while also developing the option of secession.  Holding a referendum for independence is the second choice for now, but remains a contingency plan if Iraq falls apart.\n \n - The KRG wants the following concessions:  freedom to independently sell \n   Kurdish oil; recognition of Kurdish control of Kirkuk; a guarantee from \n   Baghdad that Kurdistan resumes receiving its full share of Iraq's budget.\n  \n   - The KRG exported one million barrels of oil to Turkey in response to a \n     request from Europe.  But a U.S. court recently ruled that a tanker from  \n     Kurdistan could not unload its oil in Texas.\n   - The peshmerga took back oil production facilities in Kirkuk from ISIS.    \n     But Kirkuk is long been recognized as part of Iraqi Arab lands.\n   - Iraq currently owes the KRG $7 billion from this year's federal budget to \n     date, and the Kurds desperately need the funds.\n \n - ISIS poses a grave risk to Kurdistan's security, which it can not maintain \n   long-term without U.S. and (to a much lesser extent) Iraqi military support.\n \n - Current and future oil money from the Iraqi government in Baghdad is \n   significantly higher than any amount the KRG would get from sales solely \n   from its own territory.  Kurdistan gets 17% of Iraq's national income, \n   which was cut off in January due to KRG attempts to export its oil.  \n   Though expected to grow, Kurdistan produces less than10% of Iraq's oil \n   supply.\n \n - Kurdistan's neighbors - Iran and Turkey - have opposed independence.  \n   Both have large Kurdish minorities.  Turkey may benefit economically \n   from an independent Iraqi Kurdistan though.\n \n - International powers - the U.S. and Arab states - oppose the breakup of \n   Iraq.\n \n Sources:\n \n \"Negotiators: Kurdish Demands Supersede Ministerial Posts,\" By RUDAW, 23/8/2014 (http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/230820145)\n \n \"Iraq's future: Why the next 22 days are critical,\" By Bartle Bull, Published August 21, 2014 (http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/21/iraq-future-why-next-22-days-are-critical).\n \n \"Kurdish Independence Hangs in Limbo,\" World Policy Institute, August 19, 2014 - 9:40am (http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2014/08/19/kurdish-independence-hangs-limbo).\n \n \"Debating a Kurdish State,\" Carnegie Enowment for International Peace, Serhun Al, August 12, 2014 (http://carnegieendowment.org/sada/2014/08/12/debating-kurdish-state/hkm9).\n \n \"How far will Obama's support for the Iraqi Kurds go?\", Washington Post, By Rick Noack, August 12, 2014 (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/12/how-far-will-obamas-support-for-the-iraqi-kurds-go/)\n \n \"Kurdistan Moves Step Closer to Independence with New Election Law,\"\n By RUDAW, 24/7/2014 (http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/240720141).\n \n \"Kurdistan Isn't About to Leave Iraq Amid ISIS Fighting,\" Time, Cale Salih, Aug. 6, 2014 (http://time.com/3083172/iraq-kurdistan-independence/)",

And even after a military defeat of IS, a referendum process could still be interfered with through terrorist acts. On the other hand, a victory over IS might fuel Kurdish nationalism and make a referendum more likely. Turkey's position remains to be seen: While there has been less opposition to independence lately, a now strongly armed Kurdish state might seem less desirable by Ankara. Finally, it remains an open question how much the Kurdish leadership actually wants a referendum versus using the threat of one to gain concessions from the government in Baghdad. \n \n Overall this prediction is uncertain, as war situations tend to have many unknowns.",

        "The Lawfare blog post in the news section[1] is a must-read on this subject.  Comparing the ADIZ policies of other countries with large coastlines makes establishing an ADIZ over the South China Sea seem like a pretty reasonable thing for China to do.  One wonders why they haven't done it before now (which by itself argues for a low base rate).  I do not think they would face any international blowback from establishing an ADIZ, so long as they keep their interception procedures reasonably safe.\n \n The second thing to consider is that China seems to have been using its East China Sea ADIZ at least partly as a political tool in its territorial disputes (also discussed in [1]).  Since China's territorial disputes in the South China Sea are no less contentious than the ones in the east, bolstering their claims with an ADIZ would be true to form.\n \n Third, China's ADIZ in the East China Sea was partly motivated by pique over Japan's interception policy (and Japanese media reportage thereof) in its ADIZ.  Taiwan has been intercepting Chinese aircraft over the South China Sea [2], so establishing an ADIZ would again be consistent with past behavior.\n \n Finally, there are rumors circulating that plans for an ADIZ are already in the works [3].  Now, that's a Japanese newspaper, and they have a tendency to exaggerate China's belligerence, but I don't think they'd fabricate the story out of whole cloth.\n \n Taken together, I think these observations suggest it's very likely that an ADIZ will happen eventually.  The big unknown is, when?  Apparently there is some politics there, too[4].

As there have been 12 \"attacks\" that would satisfy the condition of this question in the last 10 years *avg. 1.2 attacks per year). Since the French attack against Charlie Hebdo would satisfy that average for 2015, an additional attack would be ABOVE average.

        "In 2011, he IMF published a detailed report on its selection criteria for the SDR basket [1].  This is the most recent information on the subject that I was able to find, and document is primarily a discussion of whether or not they should drop the old \"freely usable\" (FU) criterion in favor of a \"reserve asset criterion\" (RAC), but the document gives no real guidance about whether the change will be adopted.  The general sense of the discussion is that the FU criterion is slower to react to changes in the global financial system than the RAC because there is a lot more inertia in the general use of currencies than there is in central bank practices.  Table 4 in the report gives a summary of the indicators used for the two criteria.  Out of 4 indicators for each criterion, two are the same for both criteria, and two are unique to one of the criteria.\n \n 1) Currency composition of reserves\n 2a) Currency denomination of international banking liabilities\n 2b) Volume of transactions in foreign exchange derivatives markets and OTC derivatives trade\n 3a) Currency denomination of international debt securities\n 3b) Appropriate market-based interest rate instrument.\n 4) Volume of transactions in foreign exchange spot markets.\n \n I was able to find recent information on 1, 3a, 2b, and 4.  It turns out that as of March 2014, the share of all international debt securities denominated in RMB is \"a scant 0.3%\" [2].  From the same document, \"While there has been some growth of renminbi-denominated and related derivative instruments, internationally active firms continue to denominate the vast majority of their offshore treasury operations in dollars.\" (no exact figure given).  Meanwhile, another document published around the same time observed that \"The RMB now comprises 2.2% of all global FX turnover,\" [3] which puts it just behind the Mexican peso and well behind the Australian, Canadian, and Swiss currencies [4].  Finally, for foreign exchange reserves, RMB holdings are still lumped in under \"other currencies\"  All together these other currencies totaled just under $200B (it is not likely that the RMB dominates this total; the ruble and the Brazilian real have also seen a lot of growth), compared to $240B for the Australian and Canadian dollar combined. [5]\n \n My takeaway from all this is that for all the RMB's growth as an international currency, it is still behind some other currencies, such as the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, that are not included in the SDR basket.  It would be surprising if the RMB were added to the basket while those more widely used currencies were ignored.  However, there is an outside chance that they might add the RMB on the basis of projections that suggest that the RMB would surpass the other second-tier currencies before they next revisit the subject in 2020.  They did discuss projected growth in the report in [1], so clearly they think about these things.\n \n Finally, there is the schedule for IMF action to consider.  Here is what is in the Executive Board's latest work program [6]:  \"In May 2015, the Board will also discuss a paper on initial considerations for the quinquennial Review of Valuation of the SDR.\"  To me, this wording sounds like there won't be a final decision in May, and the question deadline is in early June.  So, even if the IMF is inclined to add the RMB, I don't think the decision will be made in time, but you never know.  As we learned with the China peak carbon question, a decision need not be enacted by a governing body to count as an \"official announcement\" for GJP purposes.  A favorable initial report accompanied by a statement from Lagarde that she thinks the change will happen might be sufficient.\n \n Taken together, I think this all implies that a 'yes' outcome is very unlikely.  I don't think the IMF will add the RMB to the basket in 2015, and I don't think they will make a decision by the deadline in any case.  However, I'm reserving a small probability that they add the RMB now on the basis of projected changes and that a moderate chance that a press release in the wake of the initial report will satisfy the judges for a 'yes' outcome.  Since both of these have to happen in order to get a 'yes', the final result is still pretty small.  I'm going with 10%.\n   \n \n [1] http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2011/092311.pdf\n [2] http://www.cifr.edu.au/assets/document/CIFR%20Internationalisation%20of%20the%20RMB%20Report%20Final%20web.pdf \n [3] https://www.db.com/en/media/At-the-centre-of-Renminbi-internationalisation--A-brief-guide-to-offshore-RMB.pdf\n [4] http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/061314/seven-emerging-currencies-challenging-forex-hierarchy.asp\n [5] http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/cofer/eng/\n [6] http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2014/061114.pdf",

The South China sea includes some fairly busy airspace.  Declaring an ADIZ can be more of  a political statement as it was in the case of the east china sea, than a practical response to worries about unidentified aircraft.  What the threshold for Chinese leaders might be is the great open question."
