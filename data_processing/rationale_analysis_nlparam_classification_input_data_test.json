        "Overall, I rate this as very unlikely, and there are several reasons for my forecast.  First, the original act that drove the conviction took place in February, and the conviction and sentences were passed down on August 17, 2012.  The three women were sentenced for two years.  The momentum behind this case has been against the three defendants for seven months at this point, and I do not see any reason for a reversal, nullification or suspension in the next several months. I acknowledge that one of these decisions could come later, especially if there is a politically expedient reason to adjust the court's decision.  This brings me to a conclusion that supports an 70% chance of \"No change.\"  Exploring the possibility of a reversal brings me to my next point.  Pussy Riot was protesting the reelection of Putin when they  engaged in what was characterized as an act of hooliganism at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.  Putin has subsequently endorsed the conviction as has the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church.  With this kind of political and social support, it is unlikely that there will be a reduced, nullified, or suspended sentence within the next several months.  This led me to increase the probability of \"No change\" from 70% to 85%.     This brings me to my third point: There have been some calls for mercy and restraint domestically, and conceivably these could prompt a decision to reduce, nullify or suspend the sentences; however,  most of the protest has originated overseas in the West.  Given the arc of Russian politics and strategy over the last several years, it is unlikely that these voices would drive the courts to reconsider the women's sentence.  This doesn't change my estimate (85%); it merely eliminates  the likelihood that external pressure will change the situation.    Finally, there are few calls for restraint and mercy within Russia for the three members of Pussy Riot (\"Fully 47% of those polled by the Levada Center in April believed that seven years' imprisonment for Pussy Riot members would be an appropriate punishment for the act, while only 10% found no criminal content in the women's actions\" - from http://www.demdigest.net/blog/?s=Levada).  Other polls assess the Russian support for Pussy Riot at 6%.  This assessment, conducted in July, does not appear to have shifted much since the sentencing in August.  This drove me to further slip the probability of \"No change\" to 95% as of mid-September.   ",
        "Turkey has invaded neighboring countries - notably Iraq - several times over the last decade.  This alone nudges me away from a firm \"No\" response.  I am evaluating this at 60% \"Yes\" at the present.  My reasoning is below.  1. As Sirfrappa out, there is much uncertainty about this question.  In this respect, there's symmetry between this and the earlier question about a foreign force firing into Syria.  This uncertainty keeps me from going decisively in one direction or another.   2. Despite this uncertainty, there is precedent for Turkey invading its neighbors, though in general the Turks have been provoked much more frequently than they have invaded.  In each one of the cases where Turkey did invade, the invasions were in response to cross-border  provocations, which in the case of Syria have occurred several times over the last several weeks.  In this respect, conditions are ripe for continued Turkish responses.  3. When the Turks moved, it was en masse.  The last incursion into Iraq reportedly number between 3,000 to 10,000 soldiers, depending on the report. This indicates to me the question isn't so much about the issue of 'a significant military forces' as it is whether or not Turkey will invade over the next six weeks (for what it's worth, I will bet - 90% certain - that Turkey already has special operations forces operating inside Syria to evaluate the environment and pull together targeting data).  4. One thing that elevates the likelihood a bit is that Turkey recently initiated counterbattery fires into Syria and detained a Russian air craft reportedly smuggling weapons into Syria.  I read these as careful escalations designed to draw out international responses.  Overall, the responses have been largely muted.  I believe the absence of strong responses will embolden the Turkish leadership to conduct a ground raid on Syrian positions to retaliate for a provocation.  5. One problem with updating this forecast is that if the Turks react, it will be in response to an Syrian provocation, and the response will be relatively quick - hours or a day or two.  The Turkish leadership has moved well past crisis management with Syria and they likely have been working through the contingency operations for several months now.  The troops are in position, the planning is ongoing if not completed, and the intelligence to support punitive raids or other operations is being gathered.    ",
        "This forecast consists of two parts: the timing of the decision and the outcome of the decision.  First, will the WTO issue a ruling in the rare earth metals complaint before 31 DEC 2013?  Once the WTO dispute panel is established, it has six months to issue a ruling, and according to the WTO site (http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/disp1_e.htm), the process takes one year without appeal or 15 months with an appeal.  The panel was formed on 23 July 2012, so it would seem that even with an appeal, the panel would issue some kind of ruling no later than late October 2013.  I factored in uncertainties and forecast that there is a 95% chance the WTO will issue a ruling before December 2013.      Second, will the ruling be in favor of the EU and against China?  In reading the history of this specific dispute (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/business/global/us-europe-and-japan-escalate-rare-earth-dispute-with-china.html) I contend there are several reasons to forecast a strong (90%) chance that China will lose the complaint.  For starters, the Chinese restrictions have been in place for more than six years, so there is ample data to bolster claims of economic damages.  Additionally, besides the EU, there 17 third party litigants to this case (including the US), so the damages are widespread.  Finally, China has a monopoly on the production of rare earth metals, so it will be difficult for the Chinese to defend the charge that the country's leaders are not abusing the monopoly as a way of forcing direct foreign investment in China.  Overall, these estimates lead me to forecast in September 2012 with an 85% probability that the WTO will rule in favor of the EU by 31 DEC 2013.",
        "Al Shabaab has recently lost Marka and Afmadhow in the Juba area, indicating that the group may be outmatched by the increasingly competent AMISOM force.  Additionally, even as Al Shabaab sustains casualties it cannot replace, the AMISOM force is, in principle, increasing in size from 12,000 to 17,000 soldiers.  More pointedly, Al Shabaab, which is a blend between a militia and a terrorist organization, lacks the combat power to hold ground - even complex terrian like a city - against a disciplined, determined conventional force.  The primary reasons I backed off on my confidence in the prediction are: the uncertainty surrounding Al Shabaab's tactical options; some residual uncertainties about the ability of the AMISOM force to defeat a determined opponent; and the broader element of chance surrounding any tactical military operation.",
        "Based on news, looks like this will happen - if it hasn't already happened (going with 100%):  Three days ago, the BBC reported talks (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19686707)  A Chinese news agency reported today (27 SEP 12) that the two had brokered a deal (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/video/2012-09/27/c_131876452.htm).

        "This could result from one of two sets of circumstances:  - Escalation between Iran and the countries opposed to its acquisition of nuclear weapons (primarily the US and Israel - A provacation between Iran and one of its geographic neighbors such that 10 or more Iranians are killed or the military forces enter Iranian territorial space.  Given the tone of the last several months and the pending American election, it seems likely that the current administration will go to great lengths to avoid an attack on Iran and will do much to dissuade Israel from making an attack.  This carries us through early November with a very low probability of an attack (1%).  The possibility rises somewhat with the political constraints relaxed, but it remains unlikely that either the Israelis or the Americans would launch an attack given the current geopolitical climate (perhaps 3%).  This assessment should be updated based on changes in the political landscape.  What is more likely and much harder to predict is the escalation of a border dispute with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, or one of Iran's other neighbors.  This is effectively a random act of violence with an modest chance, but what mitigates the likelihood is the small odds that the clash would escalate to the point where 10 Iranians are killed.  I score this as a 5%. ",

        "In 2011, he IMF published a detailed report on its selection criteria for the SDR basket [1].  This is the most recent information on the subject that I was able to find, and document is primarily a discussion of whether or not they should drop the old \"freely usable\" (FU) criterion in favor of a \"reserve asset criterion\" (RAC), but the document gives no real guidance about whether the change will be adopted.  The general sense of the discussion is that the FU criterion is slower to react to changes in the global financial system than the RAC because there is a lot more inertia in the general use of currencies than there is in central bank practices.  Table 4 in the report gives a summary of the indicators used for the two criteria.  Out of 4 indicators for each criterion, two are the same for both criteria, and two are unique to one of the criteria.\n \n 1) Currency composition of reserves\n 2a) Currency denomination of international banking liabilities\n 2b) Volume of transactions in foreign exchange derivatives markets and OTC derivatives trade\n 3a) Currency denomination of international debt securities\n 3b) Appropriate market-based interest rate instrument.\n 4) Volume of transactions in foreign exchange spot markets.\n \n I was able to find recent information on 1, 3a, 2b, and 4.  It turns out that as of March 2014, the share of all international debt securities denominated in RMB is \"a scant 0.3%\" [2].  From the same document, \"While there has been some growth of renminbi-denominated and related derivative instruments, internationally active firms continue to denominate the vast majority of their offshore treasury operations in dollars.\" (no exact figure given).  Meanwhile, another document published around the same time observed that \"The RMB now comprises 2.2% of all global FX turnover,\" [3] which puts it just behind the Mexican peso and well behind the Australian, Canadian, and Swiss currencies [4].  Finally, for foreign exchange reserves, RMB holdings are still lumped in under \"other currencies\"  All together these other currencies totaled just under $200B (it is not likely that the RMB dominates this total; the ruble and the Brazilian real have also seen a lot of growth), compared to $240B for the Australian and Canadian dollar combined. [5]\n \n My takeaway from all this is that for all the RMB's growth as an international currency, it is still behind some other currencies, such as the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, that are not included in the SDR basket.  It would be surprising if the RMB were added to the basket while those more widely used currencies were ignored.  However, there is an outside chance that they might add the RMB on the basis of projections that suggest that the RMB would surpass the other second-tier currencies before they next revisit the subject in 2020.  They did discuss projected growth in the report in [1], so clearly they think about these things.\n \n Finally, there is the schedule for IMF action to consider.  Here is what is in the Executive Board's latest work program [6]:  \"In May 2015, the Board will also discuss a paper on initial considerations for the quinquennial Review of Valuation of the SDR.\"  To me, this wording sounds like there won't be a final decision in May, and the question deadline is in early June.  So, even if the IMF is inclined to add the RMB, I don't think the decision will be made in time, but you never know.  As we learned with the China peak carbon question, a decision need not be enacted by a governing body to count as an \"official announcement\" for GJP purposes.  A favorable initial report accompanied by a statement from Lagarde that she thinks the change will happen might be sufficient.\n \n Taken together, I think this all implies that a 'yes' outcome is very unlikely.  I don't think the IMF will add the RMB to the basket in 2015, and I don't think they will make a decision by the deadline in any case.  However, I'm reserving a small probability that they add the RMB now on the basis of projected changes and that a moderate chance that a press release in the wake of the initial report will satisfy the judges for a 'yes' outcome.  Since both of these have to happen in order to get a 'yes', the final result is still pretty small.  I'm going with 10%.\n   \n \n [1] http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2011/092311.pdf\n [2] http://www.cifr.edu.au/assets/document/CIFR%20Internationalisation%20of%20the%20RMB%20Report%20Final%20web.pdf \n [3] https://www.db.com/en/media/At-the-centre-of-Renminbi-internationalisation--A-brief-guide-to-offshore-RMB.pdf\n [4] http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/061314/seven-emerging-currencies-challenging-forex-hierarchy.asp\n [5] http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/cofer/eng/\n [6] http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2014/061114.pdf",
        "The Lawfare blog post in the news section[1] is a must-read on this subject.  Comparing the ADIZ policies of other countries with large coastlines makes establishing an ADIZ over the South China Sea seem like a pretty reasonable thing for China to do.  One wonders why they haven't done it before now (which by itself argues for a low base rate).  I do not think they would face any international blowback from establishing an ADIZ, so long as they keep their interception procedures reasonably safe.\n \n The second thing to consider is that China seems to have been using its East China Sea ADIZ at least partly as a political tool in its territorial disputes (also discussed in [1]).  Since China's territorial disputes in the South China Sea are no less contentious than the ones in the east, bolstering their claims with an ADIZ would be true to form.\n \n Third, China's ADIZ in the East China Sea was partly motivated by pique over Japan's interception policy (and Japanese media reportage thereof) in its ADIZ.  Taiwan has been intercepting Chinese aircraft over the South China Sea [2], so establishing an ADIZ would again be consistent with past behavior.\n \n Finally, there are rumors circulating that plans for an ADIZ are already in the works [3].  Now, that's a Japanese newspaper, and they have a tendency to exaggerate China's belligerence, but I don't think they'd fabricate the story out of whole cloth.\n \n Taken together, I think these observations suggest it's very likely that an ADIZ will happen eventually.  The big unknown is, when?  Apparently there is some politics there, too[4].

        "All of the sources I've seen seem to agree that China will almost certainly be establishing a peak year, so the uncertainty in this question surrounds the timetable.\n \n As I read the announcement, the peak is expected to be announced as part of the next (thirteenth) five-year guideline [5], the drafting of which is just getting under way.[1]  Information on the timetable for the drafting of the plan is maddeningly hard to come by, but judging from the chronology of the 12th guideline [2] we should expect the plan to be announced following the plenary session of the Central Committee in the year prior to the year it is supposed to take effect (that's 2015 meeting/2016 effective in this case) and adopted by the National People's Congress the following spring.  As usual, GJP and its sponsor are frustratingly vague about whether the announcement from the Central Committee would count as an \"official announcement,\" since technically the plan isn't a done deal until adoption by the NPC.  However, since the NPC is widely viewed as a rubber-stamp for the Central Committee, I think the Central Committee announcement would count.\n \n The Central Committee usually holds its plenary sessions in the fall [3,4], so that would suggest that there is not much chance of an official announcement before the June cutoff.  HOWEVER, in 2013 there was an additional plenary session in February, and if they had a similar extra session in 2015, they might just be able to make an announcement then.  That said, early 2015 would be a very compressed timeline for producing the proposal for the thirteenth guideline.\n \n In light of all that, I'm going with a 10% chance of a spring plenary announcement, and another 5% chance of an announcement outside of the five-year guideline framework, for a total of 15%.\n \n \n [1] http://chinawatch.washingtonpost.com/2013/08/preparation-starts-on-13th-five-year-plan.php\n [2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China#Twelfth_Guideline_.282011.E2.80.932015.29\n [3] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China#Chronology\n [4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th_Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China#Chronology\n [5] http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/03/china-climatechange-idUKL3N0OK1VH20140603",

        "I have applied my techniques involving sums of random variables to this question. I have improved my techniques in two ways since they failed miserably on the Euro question (See Forum > Topics > Forecasting Principles > \"Question 1056: Use of normally distributed random variables\" for details).  For the Euro question, I assumed my random variables were independent, which lead to a gross overestimation of the variance of their sum. (Cobbler noticed that I had a problem, and I agreed with him, but I didn't know how to fix it.) I still don't know how a statistician would fix this, so I am now using a cheap trick. Rather than working with the daily changes in bond yields, I am working with the weekly changes. This takes into account inter-week dependence but not intra-week dependence. In this particular case it cuts the estimate of the variance in half.  My second improvement is to explicitly think about feedback that arises from changes in the bond yields themselves (\"endogenous shocks\"). For example, the interest rate can't go below zero, so as the interest rate falls, it becomes harder and harder for it to fall further. To compensate for this, I do all my computations on the bond price per dollar of interest, which is the reciprocal of the interest rate.  The article that DaveG mentioned on 1/22 pointed out that \"Prices of government bonds do not simply reflect the underlying health of government finances, they also influence them... Debts that appear sustainable at interest rates of 3-4% become unsustainable if rates move persistently to 6-7%, making it rational for investors to keep selling bonds even as they get cheaper\" or to keep buying bonds even as they get more expensive. After thinking about this, I decided that the historical data reflect this effect, so I didn't adjust for it.  The interest rate on Italian bonds and the austerity required to produce those interest rates are both issues in the election. It is clear that uncertainty about the election is keeping bond interest rates up. If Bersani becomes Prime Minister, I expect interest rates to fall below where they were just before Monti announced he would resign.  My spreadsheet says \"yes = 5%\". This is my new answer to 1190-b. My new answer to 1190-a is 10% because of my expectation that rates will fall if Bersani becomes PM.",

Does anyone have the ability to find the Delta on this Index?   If so, we can find the markets perception of the implied probability curve.\n \n The following link has some use, though I am not sure I agree with everything he is saying:\n \n http://www.learningmarkets.com/using-the-oil-vix-ovx-to-forecast-energy-prices/\n \n Factors that can affect prices positively:  OPEC decreases production, Russian Oil Taken off market,  Colder Winter, Increase demand in Asia,  Improvement in EU economy, turmoil in the production regions of middle east......\n \n Factors that can affect prices negatively:  New Discoveries going online,  Increased Efficiencies Bringing more to market, Security Resolutions in the Middle East, Decrease in Tensions where oil is being produced: Nigeria, Libya, Iraq, etc..... Switch to alternatives including natural gas.\n \n Starting high on this one.  The tenor of the question  acts like an option calculation.   The cone of probability extends above 25 further out.\n \n ",
        "I am starting with Marc and give the prospect of a cut in oil output to be low.   Here is the rationale:\n \n OPEC must contend with new sources of supply in the US, Russia and Canada.  The US does not directly export oil. However, it does export refined products.  Regardless, the impact of new North American production weakens the imports from OPEC.   In order for OPEC to gain back market share in North America and contend with China's new deals with Russian supply, it will need to keep prices lower than the cost of new  production for a longer period of time in order to drive new production off the market.  In the US, this implies a price lower than $70/barrel for the majority of North American producers.  However, there are some that only need the prices below $80/barrel  for an extended period of time before the costs outweigh the gains.    OPEC will also benefit if economies get a break from higher energy costs as the long term global economy will benefit from lower prices which will encourage more robust demand at a later date.   So, in the short term, taking market share through lower prices and weathering the pain while economies recover will help OPEC in the long term.   \n \n It is worth noting that OPEC and their quotas are difficult to monitor.   This is true of independent analysis as much as internal OPEC analysis.   It is suspected that most OPEC members cheat.   \n \n This question should be approached with game theory in mind.  What are the optimal outcomes for each player given their actions and others reactions?   Is it better to stray from the cartel in order to get more market share?   \n \n Another question to consider:  even if OPEC lowers output, will they be able to drive prices higher or would it encourage more production (and alternative sources) and thus greater supply from new sources as they attempt to grab market share at higher prices?   Is the market becoming more rational and striving to find the true supply/demand equilibrium rather than arbitrary pricing by a cartel?   Is this a sign of a change in long term oil pricing dynamics?    \n \n Countries that rely on oil to meet their national budgetary needs will be in dire straights without higher prices.   The writing is on the wall, if they cannot truly control the markets anymore, they will need to re-think their economies.  The lose in the long term if: 1. they cannot truly control prices anymore 2. they lose market share.\n \n Another question:  will China take up the demand slack anytime soon?\n \n A nice link:\n \n http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21625819-oil-price-tumbling-good-or-bad-news-world-economy-both\n \n ",

The people there will surely become more boisterous rather than calmer if China acts more aggressive.  Hong Kong is important to China for banking and business.   China needs a functioning Hong Kong for its international business and banking needs.   China may not concede the election issues (the root of the problem), but it can't afford to punish Hong Kong in the short term or the long term.\n \n http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29640500\n \n Wildcards:   Protestors become violent and China uses the violence as an excuse to deploy force from the mainland.",

Wikileaks documents indicate US Intelligence Community believed Iran received BM-25 (f/k/a Russian R-27 submarine) missiles from Iran (range of 2,000 mi/3,200 km) http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/middleeast/29missiles.html  This Congressional Research Service report from 12/6/2012 is an excellent backgrounder: http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R42849.pdf  Iran&acirc;\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Ballistic Missile and Space Launch Programs Congressional Research Service  \"Over time, it appears that some of these missile parts and components, or at least their design features, seem to have made their way into North Korean and Iranian missile and space launch programs. Postol has made this argument in assessing the Iranian Safir space launch missile, which has a second stage that appears to use the two vernier thrust chambers and common turbopump from the R-27. In addition, the unusual spatial arrangement of the two thrust chambers, their hydraulic mounts and the conical shape of the stage&acirc;\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds back-end are essentially the same as that on the R-27. Some of this is touched on briefly in the section on Iran&acirc;\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds space launch program.\" (p. 32)  So for the sake of keeping this question manageable for me, I will answer this on the assumption that the Iranian space program is both genuine and a proxy for ballistic missile testing. Rather than an overtly military test, I think it very likely that a test of the North Korean-manufactured BM-25 propulsion system would be in the guise of a satellite rocket launch.   So I will reframe this question as, Is Iran's space program likely to test launch a rocket that incorporates the BM-25 propulsion system by May 1, 2014 -- i.e., within the next 8 months?   The CRS report I cited indicates that the US and NATO were aware of secret Iranian tests of medium-range missiles in real time in 2010 and 2011 but the US delayed reporting this to the media, possibly because of the delicacy of negotiations with Russia taking place at the time. This is a good reminder that resolution criteria effectively often hinge on corroboration from official US gov't sources -- not just whether the event probably happened based on widespread reporting from anonymous sources. See, e.g., last season's widely reported (but not officially acknowledged by Jordan or the US -- or IARPA) cross border clash between Syrian and Jordanian (US?) forces.  Point being, there is precedent to suggest a non-trivial possibility that our core media sources will not publish qualifying articles in real time, but only after the release of info has been vetted by the White House/NATO. An April launch might not be acknowledged/reported in \"definitive\" form until August 2014. Since such an Iranian launch would likely violate UN Resolution 1929, it simply may not be politic for the US to \"out\" the Iranians until after a delay, depending on the needs of the moment. So I think the likelihood of a launch during the window is somewhat more likely than the \"official\" reporting to trigger positive resolution.  ",

        "Based on this source:  I think Bergdahl's release is a proxy for either successful conclusion of, or significant progress in, tripartite US-Afghan-Taliban peace talks. So reframing the question, does success in peace talks increase/decrease likelihood of US signing a SOFA in the near term? My understanding is there is a big bone of contention in an overarching strategic agreement between the US and Afghanistas goes to whether local Afghan law or US law would have jurisdiction over alleged misconduct by US/NATO troops remaining in Afghanistan for training/equipment. I don't see the US/NATO agreeing that their forces would be subject to local law. But I also don't see the US going for a \"zero option\" here, not with ongoing drone operations in Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan.  http://www.emptywheel.net/tag/status-of-forces-agreement/  www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL34531.pdf&acirc;\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  http://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/legalities-of-the-post-2014-landscape-the-us-afghan-bilateral-security-agreement  And this real \"shocker\" [sarcastic] in yesterday's WaPo: http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pentagon-afghan-forces-will-need-substantial-foreign-help-after-us-combat-ends-in-2014/2013/07/30/57b14046-f942-11e2-a954-358d90d5d72d_story.html  The lack of strict requirement from Congress that Obama \"fish or cut bait\" is just more of the same status quo abdication of legislative authority over waging war to the Executive. Will the US Congress find a spine in the short term? No. No they will not, because they are invertebrates. Because I see the likelihood of a congressional rebellion against the democratic President on the subject of the Afghan war as virtually nil in the short term, the lack of sunset provision in the existing authorization will provide sufficient \"cover\" to muddling through the coming months and keeping more US forces in Afghanistan than anyone really wants.

Previous instances include:  http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/08/18/Israel-responds-to-errant-Syrian-shelling/UPI-56011376827452/ http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57583024/syrian-mortar-shell-lands-in-golan-heights-israel/ http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/07/14/Shell-from-Syria-hits-Israeli-occupied-Golan.html  Also note that an official Syrian attack is highly unlikely due to al-Assad's current relative position of strength vis a vis FSA forces.  As noted in the WSJ article: \"The prevailing assessment of many Israeli security and regional experts is that the Syrian regime, despite veiled threats of an attack on Israel, is unlikely to attack the Jewish state in order to avoid having to fight on another front and risk losing to the rebels.\"  Engagement of conventional forces by Israel would result in heavy losses for Syria, and tie up resources needed for continued operations against FSA forces.  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323906804579039084159645284.html  In the result of a multinational strike against Syria, Israel may be the subject of small-scale retalitory strikes from Syria, which is why I assign a 10% probability (along with the aforementioned unintentional attack possibility).",
        "Russian forces in Crimea could claim plausible deniability after being deployed from bases inside the peninsula, however, such a situation does not exist in Kharkiv/Donetsk, which would require the blatant movement of troops across international borders.

In addition, both regions are home to significant industrial assets under the control of Ukrainian oligarchs with entrenched powerbases.

        "The only hostile country neighboring Israel capable of deploying attack aircraft or surface-to-surface artillery strikes is Syria.  Given ongoing civil war, previous forecasts regarding highly unlikely nature of attack against Israeli targets due to wish to avoid conventional military strikes against remaining infrastructure remain valid.    Hizbullah and Hamas retain the capability to deploy rockets/missiles, or explosives, against Israeli civilian targets, however, Hizbullah is currently deeply involved in the ongoing Syrian conflict and highly unlikely to wish to open a second front against Isreal (which would be the certain result of any attack of sufficient lethality to qualify as a \"yes\" resolution for the purposes of this question) and the last successful Palestinian attack against Israeli targets (which only resulted in injury, not death) was in November 2012.",
        "While current street protests led by Khan and Qadri brought large scale protests to Islamabad, they were not mirrored across the country at the level that could truly force political change.  Current estimates place the number of protesters still in Islamabad at around 7,000 - by comparison, there are an estimated 20,000 police deployed to the city.  Since Sharif was elected with a nearly 4:1 edge over closest challenger, giving him widespread and mass support across Pakistan, it is highly unlikely the street protests will force his resignation.\n \n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/13/us-pakistan-crisis-idUSKBN0H80DF20140913\n \n In addition, local Islamabad residents are beginning to turn against the protestors, as reported by the NY Times:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/world/asia/beleaguered-islamabad-pakistani-capital-inches-back-to-normal.html\n \n Wildcard factor, as seeforman pointed out, is whether or not the Pakistani military continues to back Sharif, or if he may be subject to a coup for the second time.

According to the Moscow TImes article and the Sophia Globe article cited below, the company was to be replaced by Gazprom subsidiary Centrgaz.

        "Agree with Seeforman on the need to utilize the long term frequency/steady-state approach when addressing this question. What concerns me in adopting this approach in this case is the wide-ranging nature of the question - i.e. \"Individual acts of violence perpetrated by non-state actors (e.g., the use of explosive devices, projectiles, or knives) would count.\"\n \n Within this context, the level of organizational support or logistical planning needed to conduct an \"attack\" is dropped to the level of walking outside with a kitchen knife and attacking a passing policeman (i.e. the 2012 attack in London on a British soldier - http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/05/22/us-britain-killing-cameron-idUSBRE94L0WU20130522). This, essentially, amounts to a random act of violence that no level of preventative policing or intelligence can prevent against.\n \n Having said that, it would make more sense to phrase this question as: \"Will the Charlie Hebdo attack inspire a copy-cat attack between 21 January and 31 March?\" Since it is already 30 January, we are left with a one month time frame for this to occur. As there have been 12 \"attacks\" that would satisfy the condition of this question in the last 10 years *avg. 1.2 attacks per year). Since the French attack against Charlie Hebdo would satisfy that average for 2015, an additional attack would be ABOVE average. Moreover, the odds of an attack in any given month, very roughly calculated (pardon my lack of statistical training), would seem then to be at a maximum, 1.2 in 12, or 10% (with a slight downgrade due to the Hebdo attack having already occured).\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Islamic_terrorist_attacks#2010.E2.80.93current\n ",

        "Following cvance on this, but increasing my own estimation that we will see strikes inside Syria against Islamic State positions before the end of the year.  Time frame is sufficient to properly plan an execute strikes against known IS positions and would be a necessary component of any strategic move to contain and eliminate threat posed by the IS in Iraq.  Continued strikes against IS that did not include Syrian targets would be insufficient to significantly degrade the group's capabilities, as demonstrated by the Taliban's resiliency in Afghanistan due to unstrikeable positions in Pakistan.  Believe the case that air strikes alone in Syria without coordinated ground attacks by either Syrian government or moderate rebel forces would be of similarly limited effect as drone strikes have been in Pakistan holds some merit, but assess that the primary purpose of strikes would be to degrade the IS' ability to occupy and hold large amounts of Iraqi territory, which should be obtainable.\n \n According to interviews with Washington experts, President Obama believes he has the authority to authorize strikes inside Syria, vastly increasing the speed at which the decision to launch them could be made, as opposed to last years Congressional vote over strikes against Syrian government positions as the result of chemical weapons use.\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-prepared-to-order-airstrikes-in-syria-as-part-of-strategy-against-islamic-state/2014/09/09/058199e2-3834-11e4-bdfb-de4104544a37_story.html\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/us/obama-isis-congress.html\n \n Moreover, US public opinion supports action in Syria and the Obama administration has already secured commitments from NATO allies to aid in a military and intelligence campaign against IS:\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-public-supports-strikes-in-iraq-syria-obamas-ratings-hover-near-his-all-time-lows/2014/09/08/69c164d8-3789-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd_story.html\n \n http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2014/09/05/kerry-hagel-urge-coalition-against-islamic-state\n ",

My gut assessment is something like 80% but the low base rate makes me very dubious about going anywhere near the extremes. So I'm calling it 65% and will be watching the news closely.

Looking at the late August polls from 2010 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_in_the_Brazilian_presidential_election,_2010) shows Rouseff with mid to high 40s and about 15% of those surveyed unsure how they would vote.

The Japanese are off-shoring investments to beat the record low yields in Japan.  Will the notorious Japanese penchant for saving trump consumer spending?

        "The election will be April-May 2014.  We've got 5-6 months of inflation to go that's running over 10%/year and the September numbers were 759.  Over half a year we expect 5% inflation taking us to almost exactly 800.  The difference between the two parts of this question is meaningless as I doubt voters will care if the index is 790 or 810.  Inflation isn't expected to break with current trends up, at least not within six months, so unless the State puts in very quickly some type of massive rural subsidy, unlikely, the neighborhood of 800 is where India will be.  Right now Congress has just over 200 and  Bharatiya Janata Party just over 100 seats and everyone else is in the noise.  549 seats total.  Congress does better in rural areas, Janata is kind of right-wing.  Trouble in rural areas could cost Congress, but the trouble isn't (much) worse than it was in 2009 when Congress got twice the seats of Janata.  The big demographic for 2014 is going to be first-time voters and the big question is whether the upper classes can be coaxed out to vote in any numbers.  If both turn out it's difficult to see that they'll produce a massive ground swell that would overturn Congress as the lead party.  Neither is a monolith.  Bad rural inflation could put a dent in Congress' lead, but I doubt there'll be a 50% swing towards Janata.",

They can't simply cancel the last of four releases and it's only very slightly more likely they'll stick at two or three of the one hundred and four and free the rest.  One waffle would be to backtrack on one or two and substitute one or two high profile prisoners not in the one hundred and four and this would be the most likely because it'd be hard for the Palestinians to gripe if they got a few releases they'd not expected, a gift.

What could derail this would be Boko Haram switching tactics from taking and holding territory to terrorist attacks (suicide bombers etc.).

        "2012 was the least amount of sea ice over an entire year.  2010 and 2011 were trending towards that low and 2013 rebounded well back towards more ice.  However arctic temperatures this year so far appear to be a bit higher than last year (I am having an awful time finding simple charts of this) in fact they resemble those of 2012 the year of the minimum.  That said, recently 2014 and 2013 temperatures aren't that different.  Earlier in the year when 2014 was being consistently warmer than 2013 there was less sea ice extent this year.   Right now however 2014 is just slightly ahead of the same point in 2013 in terms of sea ice yet at this point 2014 is still looking slightly warmer than the same point in 2013.  Water in the Arctic Ocean circulates up past Norway and the sea temperatures off Norway are just a tad above average which might suggest a slight trend to Arctic ice melt but it doesn't look dramatic.  Based almost entirely on the fact that 2014 looks to be slightly warmer than 2013 over the past month or two yet the sea ice is holding just slightly higher in range (about 5%) I'd have to go with 2014 three weeks out holding on to an edge.  In the previous three weeks from today (8/23) the ice dropped 17% thus making up that 5% difference in the next three weeks would be quite a swing.  So I'd give this a slight edge towards NO.  I've not been able to find a long term temperature forecast and if I get more time for this I'll look for that.",

The U.S. isn't going to fire unless fired upon, the Iranians are sufficiently disciplined not to take on a carrier task force with two destroyers.  On land all it takes is one drunk, mentally unstable, or testosterone overloaded soldier to start a lethal confrontation.  Not true at sea.  I agree with Doe that the only possibility would be fire from shore at either the Iranian or U.S. vessels.  Highly unlikely that would result in a casualty.

        "Day to day moves tend to be a penny at most and it's currently at $1.14.  So a big one day move isn't going to take it there, it's got to be a sustained trend of at least five or six days.  The Euro tumbled about the 4\u00c2\u00a2 it would have to drop again over the past month and we've got nearly three months on this question so another month like last would do it.  Over the year it's dropped about 25\u00c2\u00a2, about 2\u00c2\u00a2/month, and again this trend would take us below $1.10.  So this wouldn't be unprecedented.  Podemos could well pull a Syriza in Spain, or at least wind up in a ruling coalition, but the elections are way past May 1 and even strong polls for them won't move the Euro much by then.  German growth numbers shocked (correct word) this week on the upside, nobody else is absolutely falling apart.  I can make a case that a Grexit would be bullish for the euro.  Thus while by the charts the Euro could be at about $1.08 by May I think this may well be a case of 'sell on the rumour buy on the news' and that we'll see a relatively stable euro because Grexit is already factored in and there are some bright spots.  What could change my mind fast would be some kind of big time uptick in the U.S. economy.  This isn't only about the euro falling, it's as much about the dollar rising and boy is it ever.",

This Campos/Silva phenomenon may be a blip but it does show that Neves has shaky support because Silva surged at his expense, not that of Rousseff.  Silva or Neves, either way those voters aren't going to Rousseff.  A chart on the Economist page shows polls going back eight months and Rousseff has never been above the 50% needed to avoid a runoff and she's trending down.  So based on Rousseff's consistent lack of 50% but also consistent lead over everyone else I can't see either she or anyone else breaking 50%.  Gotta watch the Silva thing however and I'll try to remember to revisit this question next week.

Our premise is that Rezalan hasn't done anything criminal by Western judicial standards and it's probably correct.  As it doesn't benefit Iran externally to keep him imprisoned & he hasn't committed a textbook crime then his imprisonment accomplishes something for one internal faction in a dispute with another and that'd almost have to be the hardliners.  With the potential for a power shift in the direction of the hardliners I can't see the motivation for them to give up this weapon (Rezalan's imprisonment) at this time.

Waves of attacks by Muslim and Christian militias have killed hundreds, if not thousands, in Central African Republic since rebels seized power in March 2012. A UN official warned on Thursday of the risk of a genocide.  Georgieva, who has visited CAR twice since the crisis erupted, told Reuters in an interview that initially people were wary of speaking out about the sectarian violence because they were concerned it would become a self-fulfilling prophecy, like \"pulling the tail of the devil\".  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is due to submit a report to the Security Council next month with recommendations for a possible UN peacekeeping force that would take over from the African troops.  \"The option of a UN peacekeeping operation must be looked into very seriously,\" Georgieva said.  \"While it is very good for Africans to help each other, Central African Republic, being where it is, makes it more difficult, more complex for an African solution because of the complicated relations between Chad and Central African Republic,\" she said.  The United Nations said on Tuesday that a UN human rights team has gathered testimony that Chadian citizens, including peacekeepers, carried out mass killings.  CAR - with a population of 4.6-million - lies at a crossroads of conflict in the heart of Africa, with Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia to the east, the Islamist threat in the Sahel region to the north-west and the revolts of the Great Lakes to the south-east.  \"The Central African Republic is bad, but it is not yet Somalia, it is not yet al-Qaeda, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram territory. We act now, it doesn't turn into one, but it would take a very strong effort,\" Georgieva said. ",

Most recently (29 October 2013) India was \"undertaking a comprehensive study on this important subject\".  http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-10-29/news/43495897_1_agreements-countries-ties  The two sides showed a great deal of interest in reaching a Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  In a joint statement yesterday, the two countries underlined that a bilateral Free Trade agreement will have a \"positive impact\" on increasing prosperity and wellbeing of the people of two countries.  \"The Peruvian side welcomed Indian initiative of undertaking a comprehensive study on this important subject that will have far reaching implications for both the countries,\" the statement added.  http://www.gatewayhouse.in/peru-indias-new-billion-dollar-trade-partner-in-latin-america/  \"ndia&apos;s exports to Peru should cross a billion dollars in 2014, given the high rate of growth in recent years. But India&apos;s exports are at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the exports from Peru&apos;s free trade agreement (FTA) partners. Peru has signed FTAs with a number of countries including China, U.S., Japan, Thailand, and Singapore; it is a member of regional economic groupings such as the Pacific Alliance, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and Andean Community.   It is in India&apos;s interests to initiate negotiations to sign an FTA/ PTA with Peru to address the disadvantages of Indian exporters to the Peruvian market.\"",

        "Based on this source:  http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11163543  UNITED NATIONS (AP) The United Nations chief says \"an atmosphere of fear and intimidation\" in Guinea-Bissau threatens national elections that have been postponed into 2014.  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a report accepted Tuesday by the U.N. Security Council that a climate of lawlessness and official repression in the coup-plagued West African country \"does not facilitate the creation of a conducive environment for peaceful and credible elections.\"  Ban recommended that neighboring nations provide the U.N. mission there with military police guards for government officials, offices and polling stations until after the elections.  Jose Ramos-Horta, the U.N. special representative to Guinea-Bissau, confirmed to reporters that the Security Council is considering authorizing two police units totaling about 300 West African police officers for the task, up from the current force of about 400 there.  Ramos-Horta told the council that \"the human rights situation in Guinea-Bissau has continued to deteriorate, with increased cases of intimidation, threats, and restrictions of freedom of expression and assembly, as well as continuing interference of the military in the affairs of the state.\"   Guinea-Bissau's interim president earlier this month postponed elections that had been set for Nov. 24. The new date has been set for March 16, 2014.  Guinea-Bissau was just weeks away from a presidential runoff vote when a military coup occurred in April 2012.  No leader in nearly 40 years of the country's independence has finished his term in office.  Ramos-Horta said that if any amnesty law were adopted to pacify the country, it would need to contain \"absolutely clear, rock-solid conditions\" requiring reform of the army and security forces and their pledge to respect the election results, which would be revoked if there was any new coup attempt.  Ramos-Horta added, \"I am persuaded that this time around, elections will be held on schedule.\"",

Kismayo will likely also not be the comparative cakewalk that the previously captured cities were.  This city is Al Shabab's main hub, especially concerning revenue.  If it falls, they will likely fall, too.  I consider Al Shabab politically incompetent, but it's hard to judge their current military strength.  They still have several thousand fighters and may have spared the best for their last stand.  Kismayo isn't particularly large, but not very accessible for armored units.  The attackers would have to use significant numbers of ground troops to clear and hold the densely populated areas that cannot be easily reached by tanks.  The attackers apparently have enough troops, but I'm not sure what they will do when their casualties mount significantly, which is likely if Al Shabab stands their ground.  The latter have clearly shown that they are willing to hold the inhabitants hostage and use them as human shields.  This will make it much harder for the attackers to advance.  If Al Shabab plays it smart, they might leverage the disagreement among their attackers.

The area he could be hiding in is large, but the US and its regional allies would likely be able to access most parts easily, which wasn't the case with Pakistan.  US surveillance technology is also so good that the use of any means of modern communication would likely spell his doom.  Unless he hides out with only a small group of his most loyal supporters in the deepest jungle (he probably does), he would likely be found within months.  The main question is how serious the US is about him.  I'd say it would likely not be more than token support, certainly nothing like large numbers of US special forces being airlifted from one possible jungle hideout to the next or intelligence officers swarming the area to gain hints from the local population.

I don't think there will be a deliberate official Syrian military attack on Israel as a result of a US-led strike, assuming that the targets of the US strike remain somewhat limited (just anti aircraft defense and chemical weapons systems).  If the US launches a broader attack, it risks exactly this kind of attack on its own interests and those of its allies in the region - so I think the US will intend these strikes to be limited and punitive in scope (but we must allow for some risk of miscalculation/misperception).  That said, I think the risk of a Syrian bullet accidentally flying over the border into Israel is significantly higher - as noted below, this has happened before although it's often unclear whether these bullets originate with the govt forces or with the rebels.

There seems to be a disconnect between what the government is aiming for, rhetorically, and what it is able to accomplish. The area subject to protests and acts of violence is insecure and that doesn't bode well for such a sensitive operation. Thoughts ?",

        "Following teammates  SMK, who deserves +10 for his outstanding comment. The likelihood of any one country is low, but all it takes is one country implementing a tiny control. The bar is very low for controls, IMHO.  It could be limited to a sector, limited to a single financial instrument, and temporary.   And I also see a lot of ambiguity.  For example, it does not appear like an official announcement is required.  What if Reuters ran a story about someone claiming to have been told by someone that she had to wait a week before purchasing dollars? Surely a motivated person (which I am probably not) could find an obscure central bank notice about currency transactions being delayed due to a computer malfunction.

        "I have asked for clarification regarding whether the Syrian army counts as a national military force for the purposes of this question.  Assad is constantly using \"national military force(s) to oppose armed groups in Syria (e.g., airstrikes, the deployment of troops).\"  By any chance did the question-writers intend to exclude Syria's army from the question?  I can't find any wording that excludes the Syrian army.\n \n Aside from that, some initial thoughts: \n \n (N1) There could be unacknowledged strikes, which wouldn't count.  But I think the US military has a strong motivation to acknowledge strikes.\n (N2) Unintentional attacks wouldn't count.  But last year's situation, where Israel acknowledged firing into Syria in response to unacknowledged firing in the other direction, presumably would count (much to the chagrin of some supers).\n (N3) Per Koloj's question, I'm guessing a CIA strike wouldn't count (not military - maybe this is a good request for clarification), and also might not be acknowledged.\n (N4) The US would prefer to avoid striking Syria if it can.\n (N5) Can the US legally strike in Syria?  I heard a radio report about a US congressman proposing a bill to explicitly allow strikes against IS anywhere.\n \n (Y1) Three months.  That's a pretty long time given the operational tempo of IS, and the US as well.  \n (Y2) The US has drones gathering intelligence over Syria.  The media's presumption is that is a prelude to strikes.\n (Y3) Executions of journalists, with more to follow.  Paraphrasing James Baker's comments to his Iraqi counterpart in early 1991: If you do such and such bad thing, \"the American public would demand vengeance, and we have the means to extract it.\"\n (Y4) A lot of pundits say the US needs to strike IS in Syria as well as Iraq.) \n (Y5) An attack on any armed group in Syria counts.\n (Y6) Come to think of it, there doesn't even need to be an attack.  Deployment of troops counts.  What about deploying an armed Predator in Syrian airspace, but without an actual strike? \n (Y7) Lots of other countries could get involved, although I would put the highest percentage on the US: \n   (a) Israel\n   (b) UK?\n   (c) Iran\n   (d) Saudi Arabia?\n   (e) UAE?

Security Council has expressed \"profound disappointment'' about the failure of South Sudan President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar to finalize a peace deal.\n \n A council statement issued Tuesday again threatened sanctions against \"senior individuals'' whom it deemed \"responsible for actions or policies that threaten the peace, security or stability of South Sudan.''\n \n Fighting in the oil-rich East African country has killed tens of thousands and displaced more than 2 million people.\n \n The Security Council has been considering sanctions for almost a year. Earlier this month, it established a sanctions regime for South Sudan but stopped short of imposing travel bans and asset freezes on officials, or creating an arms embargo.\n \n (2) IMHO timing is a big issue.  Is this something that will actually play out in the next 8 weeks?  It does not seem so.  Google News didn't show anything in the past 3 weeks.  If they express profound disappointment on 24 March, surely they will wait a while before discussing further steps.  Then they have to discuss it, and vote.  If they are really spun up, I suppose they could go through that entire cycle in less than 8 weeks.\n \n (3) The UN could adopt a South Sudan resolution that does not involve an arms embargo.\n http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-25/un-security-council-condemns-south-sudanese-leaders-war-tactics\n The Security Council established a sanctions regime on March 3 to decide on punitive measures that could include asset freezes, travel bans or an arms embargo.\n \n (4) Here is the actual UN 3 March announcement\n http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50231#.VS6dAiHBzGc\n Furthermore, the Council decided that it could impose a travel ban and an assets freeze for an initial period of one year on individuals and entities designated by a sanctions committee to be established through the resolution. The travel ban would apply to individuals, while the assets freeze would apply to individuals as well as entities such as government, opposition or militia groups.\n \n To assist the relevant Sanctions Committee in its work, the Council requested the Secretary-General to set up a five-member panel of experts to provide information relevant to the potential designation of individuals and entities. Renewal of the panel's mandate would be considered no later than 2 March 2016. Among other responsibilities, the panel will collect and analyse information regarding the flow of arms and related military assistance to those undermining the peace process and committing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.\n \n (4) Note \"The United States and European Union have already independently imposed travel bans and asset freezes on commanders on both sides.\" - http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/18/us-southsudan-war-idUSKBN0ME1OR20150318\n \n (5) Is there any reason to believe Russia and/or China would block such a resolution? \n \n (6) It seems to me like a resolution of some kind will happen, unless the opposing sides miraculously stop fighting.  But will it involve an arms embargo?\n \n (7) Apparently the only country shipping arms in the past to South Sudan has been China.  See article below.  But China may have already stopped.  If they have, what is the point of an arms embargo if there are no arms being shipped?  Is there symbolic value in a UN resolution?\n \n http://www.businessinsider.in/This-GIF-shows-how-Chinas-arms-exports-have-exploded-since-2000/articleshow/46691269.cms\n \n A large part of Beijing's weapons trade is in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where China has long been attempting to build political influence to gain access to raw materials, as well as emerging labor and consumer markets.

        "Moody's downgraded Greece to Ca in July following announcement of the proposed debt exchange; a further downgrade to C would only occur if Greece were actually in default, most likely if a distressed exchange occurred. It is widely expected that a restructuring will occur and that the haircut will be substantially higher than agreed in the July deal.\n\n\n\nThere is considerable pressure to clarify the size of the haircut (which would enhance the credibility of the ongoing bank recapitalization efforts) and to demonstrate that Greece will have a sustainable debt trajectory when the next tranche of funding is released in early November, as well as delivering some debt relief to Greece as compensation for the very painful reforms it's undertaking. The troika has already acknowledged that the recession will be deeper than anticipated.\n\n\n\nThus, I think it is highly likely that a modified deal will be announced ahead of the G20 meeting. However it's not clear that a distressed exchange actually needs to occur by 30 November: the 8bn aid tranche will easily cover 3.6bn of debt maturities in November (vs an additional 6.86bn in December). Given the desirability of recapitalizing banks before completing the debt exchange, I think it's more likely that the restructuring will occur in December or later.\n\n\n\nGiven the high likelihood that the November funding tranche will be disbursed, I think there's a negligible probability that Greece will miss an interest or principal payment in the meantime.",
        "Berlusconi appears to be healthy and has access to excellent medical care. I'd guess there is at most a 1% chance that he vacates office due to death or incapacitation.\n\n\n\nI think there is also about a 2% chance that there will be a financial crisis in the Euro Area during September that is severe enough to trigger a change of Government in Italy. I think there's another 2% chance that he's forced from office due to political pressure from the Euro Area because the financial markets don't find his fiscal austerity plan credible.\n\n\n\nAside from that, while Berlusconi has been very adept at staying in office so far, there are specific legal, political and media pressures on him right now (the criminal trial, controversial comments to Lavitola) that suggest there he has an elevated risk of losing power right now. I'd peg this at 3% since it annualizes to about a 1-in-3 chance.\n\n\n\nMultiplying this out gives about a 92% survival probability, which seems rather low to me, but I'll stick with it pending further comments.",
        "First, what's the market consensus? 10-year BTPs are about +350 vs Bunds implying (if you assume 60% recovery) about a 9% annual probability of default. That's a risk-neutral probability and it's very sensitive to the (unknown) recovery assumption, but I think it's fair to say the consensus is somewhere between 5% and 10%. But it changes every day.\n\n\n\nNow 5%-10% is a fairly high default probability, but not unreasonable due to the structural issues noted in other comments.\n\n\n\nThis is a long term average probability. I'd agree with the comments that Italy is probably easily able to avoid default in the near term. However, two reasons to be cautious are (a) the market is capable of putting unexpected pressure on Italy, as we saw just a month ago, and (b) Italy's running a primary surplus, so default would in theory not be as painful as it is in, e.g., Greece.\n\n\n\nStill, since default would probably mean significant contagion, a series of bank nationalizations (not just in Italy) and a change of Government, policymakers have a very strong incentive to avoid it at all costs.",

The only town govt has captured so far close to Kismayo is Afmadow, while they've captured a bunch of little towns around Mogadishu.  Nov 1 feels like a assume-everything-goes-well date.  That already makes me lean no.  Also, they recently have started elections, so willpower is lessened a bit as people turn their attention to grabbing goodies and making deals in the political structure.    The only factor I see on govt side is that they aren't bragging about it.

        "Would be very happy to hear from others with more data/different views on this one- another I didn't forecast last year.  There are two ways the new constitution could pass: - 60% of parliament (330 votes) + a referendum win. AK has 327 votes so this would require peeling off some Kurdish BDP lawmakers. Referenda must take place after at least 60 days, but the last one took 120 days thanks to a ruling of the supreme election board (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2010). - 67% of parliament + presidential assent. AK + Kurds/independents is insufficient here-- this would be an agreement with the opposition.  I was only able to find one poll: http://www.todayszaman.com/news-318446-survey-reveals-growing-public-apprehension-over-democratic-process.html-- would be glad to see others. Wiki says the source is a pro-AK paper (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today's_Zaman) though the text doesn't sound very pro-AK, so I'm not sure how many grains of salt to take it with. In any case it indicates that about 60% of the population would disapprove of an AK-BDP constitution (which would give the Kurds autonomy), and only 30% support a presidential system (vs. 43% disapprove) vs. 35% approve in April. It also shows AK losing a number of seats if elections were held today but likely still retaining a majority.  Upshot-- I'll put 10% on an agreement with the opposition over the next 6 months, and 10% on an AKP-BDP constitution being approved in time to have a referendum by February, with 60% that it's approved if so (assuming that the world in which AK proposes a referendum is also a world in which they think they're more likely to win than the above poll implies).",

Clearly it is only a matter of time before Greece formally defaults and is granted this rating, so the only question is whether this happens during the next 50 days.

So even if all the pieces seemingly fall into place, something else could arise and hold it up.\n - At this moment, for me A1 is dominating A2, so I'll start high on conditional A.\n \n For option B, I'm torn between the following:\n - B1: I don't expect Modi to change his stance, so if the rules aren't changed, a Yes outcome here is very unlikely.\n - B2: But what if a parallel side-deal was reached (as hinted at in Sandy's DW article) which did not explicitly change the subsidy rules, but which did guarantee that India would not be penalized for violating those rules?  I'm looking at this scenario as a moderately likely outcome, if conditional B is what ultimately counts.

Bryan Simpson's LA Times link re. US support of AU force also tends to increase my estimate of P(No): presumably, US would rather see al-Shabaab trounced as thoroughly as possible, if it could be done without significant US casualties.  I'm keeping P(Yes) on the order of 1/4 because of al-Shabaab's territory losses, which might increase their willingness to negotiate.

In the absence of such a resolution, there'd be a strong incentive not to use them.    In case B (no substantial lethal confrontation), Assad's advantages in conventional heavy weapons, air power, etc., seem to make CBW unnecessary to suppress domestic insurrection.  (I assume that a \"Yes\" outcome would not be triggered by the use of \"conventional\" chemicals, e.g. tear gas.)  I suspect that case A (substantial lethal confrontation) would take place if and only if there were a UNSC resolution.  Moreover, I assume that it would open with aerial attacks, and that ground troops, against whom CBW would actually be useful, wouldn't be introduced until after heavy strikes against suspected CBW depots.  Finally, use of CBW would greatly reduce the likelihood that an ousted Assad could find asylum elswhere.  My estimates for P(Yes) are based on a scenario in which a field commander makes an independent decision to employ CBW.  In case A, there's some question as to what consitutes \"Syria\" in \"Will Syria use...?\"  I can visualize a situation where, with the Assad regime toppling and the country in chaos, someone declares themselves the new Syrian government and uses seized chemical weapons against other claimants, or tries to win Arab-world support by launching CBW attacks on Israel.

        "Asahi Shimbun ran a piece in late January, about two months after the announcement of China's East China Sea ADIZ, quoting unnamed Chinese government sources as saying that a South China Sea ADIZ was in the works.  Per the Asahi article, one of the major practical difficulties involved was the lack of ground-based Chinese radar installations that would allow monitoring of the area: either routine flights by radar-equipped aircraft, or the construction of permanent installations on rocks in the sea would be necessary in order to make the ADIZ effective.\n \n A WSJ piece on the Aug. 19 US-CH aerial encounter off Hainan suggests that it and other close calls might possibly be attributed to a \"rogue pilot or group of pilots\" in the area.  However, an Asahi article on some May and June JP-CH aerial encounters in the East China Sea suggested the same thing; and two such sets of events in two different regions makes that explanation somewhat harder to believe.\n \n The same WSJ piece includes the paragraph: \"Some analysts have said that China may be preparing to declare an air defense zone in the airspace above the South China Sea similar to one it announced last November for the East China Sea. A U.S. national security official has said such a move would be provocative and destabilizing.\"  The response by the US official doesn't really give a good reason why the Chinese shouldn't do it...\n \n A Diplomat piece states that on Aug. 25, two separate Chinese aircraft crossed Taiwanese airspace going both two and from the South China Sea, and notes that Chinese aircraft have previously detoured around Taiwan.\n \n A June 2014 Diplomat article, based on a South China Morning Post piece, states that China is considering the construction of an artificial island on the Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratlys; if built, this would presumably provide the radar coverage that the January Asahi article said would be needed to make an ADIZ effective.  The Diplomat piece indicates that the development of the artificial island would take a decade, but the whole 5-km^2 project presumably doesn't have to be complete before it can serve as a radar installation.  Bloomberg reports that CH is also building an artificial island on Johnson South Reef in the Spratlys, and notes that airstrips on such artificial islands could be used to support an ADIZ.\n \n Going somewhat high on recent Chinese activity in the area; staying down at 30% because some kind of permanent radar installation (and possibly airbase as well) would seem necessary: CH isn't going to want to announce an ADIZ, then quietly back down on enforcing it, so they'll want to be sure that they can detect and intercept anything flying into the zone.  Not sure if roughly one year is enough time to get such a system set up on Fiery Cross and/or Johnson South Reef.\n --\n January Asahi piece: http://ajw.asahi.com/article/asia/china/AJ201401310211\n WSJ on US-CH Hainan incident: http://online.wsj.com/articles/midair-encounter-of-chinese-jet-and-u-s-surveillance-plane-exposes-limits-of-warming-ties-1408896137\n Asahi on May-June CH-JP incidents: http://ajw.asahi.com/article/asia/china/AJ201408240013\n Diplomat piece on CH incursions in Taiwan airspace: http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/chinese-surveillance-aircraft-enter-taiwans-airspace/\n Diplomat on Fiery Cross project: http://thediplomat.com/2014/06/china-may-build-artificial-island-in-south-china-sea/\n South China Mourning Post on ditto: http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1527059/china-plans-artificial-island-disputed-spratlys-chain-south-china-sea\n Bloomberg on Johnson South Reef: http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-19/china-builds-artificial-islands-in-south-china-sea\n ",
        "I built a Monte Carlo model to simulate the closing prices from now through October 31.  The model was based on an efficient-markets hypothesis (so that the expected value of the TOPIX on any future date is equal to the current price), and the assumption that recent day-to-day changes could provide information on the magnitude, though not the direction, of near-future day-to-day changes.\n \n I began with the historic closing prices from May 30 through August 29.  For each of the 64 trading days after the first, I calculated the ratios r=P(t)/P(t-1) and 1/r=P(t-1)/P(t).  I didn't distinguish between weekday-to-weekday changes and Friday-to-Monday changes.\n \n For my simulations, I began with the August 29 closing price of 1277.97.  For each subsequent weekday through October 31, I simulated a closing price by taking the previous day's price and multiplying it by an R obtained by randomly choosing one of the 64 ratios r and then randomly choosing either R=r or R=1/r.\n \n I ran 10,000 such simulations.  In 1,572 of these, the simulated closing price was at or below 1200 on at least day.  Based on this, I'm going to go with P(Yes)=16%.\n \n Note that this model doesn't take psychological barriers into account (I haven't had time to read the Koedijk-Stork paper linked by John Doe yet).  However, since I'm getting a much lower number than the rest of the group, I'm not going to worry about that too much for now-I should be looking for reasons why I might want to push my forecast closer to the group's range, rather than trying to find ways to push it still further away.\n \n Attaching my spreadsheet; would appreciate hearing from anyone who spots a hole in my argument, or a glitch in my calculations.",

Another way to say A: if a foreign force confronts Syria, will Syria respond with chemical weapons?  Another way to say B: if a foreign force does not confront Syria, will the regime use chemical weapons on civilians?  Perhaps Syria is \"saving\" the chemical weapons as a deterrent against foreign forces, partially out of fear that their use would precipitate the intervention of a foreign force.  However, there might be a commitment problem here. Can the regime make a credible threat to use chemical weapons if a foreign force enters? If a foreign force was actually present, would using chemical weapons at that point be to Assad's advantage? I speculate that the answer is no to both of these questions.

The only thing really delaying it is an election audit and resulting uncertainty, who actually will be the president to sign it.\n \n The USA formally needs the BSA before the end of 2014, and knows it can probably get it from any of the two possible presidents.

When China has increased military capabilities in the region\n \n China currently lacks the capabilities to adequately monitor and enforce such a zone in the South China Sea. The PLA Air Force's (PLAAF) limited aerial refueling capabilities constrain its ability to project airpower. While the PLAAF does have radar capabilities, including passive electronically-scanned array radars for fighters and an over the horizon radar system, it cannot cover the entire South China Sea. The PLA Navy's aircraft carrier Liaoning, which recently conducted an exercise there, could help monitor the airspace, but it will not be fully operational for a few years.\n \n China is increasing its capabilities and presence within its claimed nine-dashed line, however. The South Sea Fleet conducted a combat drill last October and in January three Chinese ships patrolled James Shoal, an island 50 miles from Malaysia that marks the southernmost part of China's territorial claim. Beijing plans to base a 5,000 ton civilian patrol ship in Sansha City, on the Paracel Islands, from which it will \"establish a regular patrol system\" to safeguard the nation's maritime interest. Once China develops sufficient capabilities to effectively monitor the sea and airspace in the region, the establishment of an ADIZ in the South China Sea is more likely.\n \n 2. When China has convinced its neighbors of its non-aggressive intentions\n \n 3. When China feels provoked by neighbors\n \n \n At present China lacks sufficient military capabilities to enforce such a zone, has yet to successfully persuade its neighbors of China's benign intentions, and does not see regional nations as posing an imminent threat to Chinese interests. Therefore, Beijing is unlikely to establish an ADIZ for the time being. It is only a matter of time, however, before China attains the necessary military capabilities to maintain an ADIZ in the South China Sea. Once China has that military capacity, either of the other two factors above could trigger a new ADIZ. If China is both strong enough and can either successfully convince its neighbors in the South China Sea of its benign intentions, or if Beijing feels sufficiently threatened by those same neighbors, China will then be highly likely to set up an ADIZ in the area.\n ",

        "Leader of the separatist Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), he has been imprisoned since 1999, and has not met with his lawyers in 15 months.  He has just called for an end to a hunger strike on the park of over a thousand PKK prisoners; one of their requests was that Ocalan be released from isolation (not from prison), but none of their requests were met. See additional info below from the Economist:  The Kurds are unlikely to stop their hunger strike until Mr Ocalan is granted access to his lawyers as they demand. Mr Ocalan's status is shrouded in mystery. He has not met the lawyers for 15 months. The government claims this is because the ferry that carries them to his island prison south of Istanbul has broken down. Nobody believes this, not least because Mr Ocalan's younger brother visited him in September. He returned saying the PKK leader was unkempt and was upset by the escalation in PKK violence that prompted Mr Erdogan to scupper secret peace talks.  Yet the younger Mr Ocalan shed no light on whether it was his brother who is shunning the lawyers or the government that is blocking their visits. Proponents of the first theory speculate that Mr Ocalan will not see the lawyers (or ask the PKK to end its violence) unless the government moves him from solitary confinement to house arrest. Backers of the second idea think the government wanted to break the links between Mr Ocalan and his fighters (the lawyers carried messages) in hopes of triggering a leadership struggle that would fracture the PKK.

Although the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment after Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2002, Mr Ocalan's status remains controversial, with many Turks openly supporting a return of the death penalty in his case.  Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan recently reminded his party that opinion polls favour the return of the death penalty.  Recognised as a terrorist group by the US and the European Union, the PKK has waged an insurrection in south east Turkey since the mid-1980s.  ",

Ukraine just completed a small war with Russia. Why would it be any different. Russia would object just as strenuously to Ukraine receiving a MAP as they would to Georgia receiving one. I think they have achieved a fragile peace in Ukraine. The Ukrainian army is a wreck having lost something like 2/3 of their vehicles.\n \n NATO is not in great shape right now.

        "Based on this source:  \"A constitution shall be considered to have banned political parties based on religion if it includes language that forbids the organization of, or participation in elections by, a party or parties on the basis of criteria that specifically reference religion, faith, sect, or denomination, regardless of which religion(s) or faith(s) is/are being mentioned.\"  First of all, the Freedom and Justice Party is the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood. However, FJP does not specifically mention religion, faith, sect or denomination, so it was technically legal. Furthermore, the Al-Nour Party, because it also does not specifically mention religion, faith, sect or denomination, is technically legal. If these two religious parties can easily continue being religious parties simply by not mentioning their religion, then I don't see why they would oppose such a toothless ban. In fact, if I recall correctly, FJP and Al-Nour has some token non-Muslim members, just to prove that they aren't entirely based on religion.  Second of all, the Morsi constitution, the constitution that was so controversial that it led to the military coup that overthrew him, also banned political parties based on religion. Article 6: No political party may be based on discrimination of gender or origin or religion.\"  Now, there's the possibility that Egypt may spiral into a civil war or the military dictatorship in Egypt gets overthrown, thereby preventing any constitutional ban from ever being imposed.

        "MAPs serve as a dangerous liability for NATO, because it requires NATO to actually make a commitment to defend these countries. Georgia and Ukraine has clear reasons to want to join NATO...because it needs to be protected from Russia.

And NATO would had to be dragged into such a war, or risk being seeing as an outdated relic of the 20th century that can't even defend its memberstates.\n \n NATO may help to deter aggression. Russia might not want to attack a country if it is aligned with NATO. However, one could argue that it is the potential of NATO expansion that is responsible for Russia's aggressive posture of Georgia and Ukraine, as if those two countries were to join, then Russia's power would weaken (because it can't bully them anymore). And, as a result, pursuing a MAP might lead to escalation from Russia that would lead to that bloody nuclear war that NATO dreads.\n \n Russia also has economic ties with the West, but as the recent sanctions prove, the West is ready to abandon those ties when they feel it necessary. There's also the wildcard of the ceasefire unraveling in Ukraine and the West deciding that Russia is far too rogue to be \"appeased\". In that case, if a new Cold War begun, there's no reason to pander to Russia's security paranoia. The MAPs would then be duly issued, and NATO will brace for the possibility of nuclear war.

        "ABSTRACT: There does not appear to be any support in the Iraqi government for Kurdish demands to stay within Iraq, as their demands for staying in are way too extreme. Kurdish ethnic cleansing in the disputed areas that they occupied also indicate that Kurdistan is not sincere in negotiations and are more interested in seizing territory. The only people that MIGHT support their federalist demands, the Sunnis, have pulled out of talks with the Iraqi government.\n \n While a lot of countries are opposed to Kurdistan's independence referendum, it's hard to see what would convince Kurdistan to reduce their federalist demands to something that might be acceptable to Iraq. Kurdistan plans to hold a referendum in late 2014.\n ---\n REASONING:\n On one hand, Al Araibya[1] claims that the referendum will happen some time in late 2014, though it still needs to be scheduled. The Kurdish people support independence, and they see an opportunity to gain that independence with the current chaos in Iraq.\n \n On the other hand, the only people actually wanting independence are the Kurds (and maybe the Turks, since the Turks has economic connections to Kurdistan). Literally nobody else wants Kurdish independence, and the US has came out strongly against it. Since Kurdistan is relying heavily on US backing, it has to be able to pull back from all this \"independence\" talk.\n \n The Kurds claim that they are willing to stay in Iraq only if Iraq agrees to a strong federalism plan that would, according to the New York Times[2], grant it \"the right to sell their own oil, buy their own arms and conduct referendums on whether disputed areas should join the Kurdish region, as well as the establishment of a new mechanism to prevent any \"abuses of power\" by the new leadership in Baghdad\". The Americans are scoffing at these demands as the Kurds demanding \"de facto\" independence.\n \n On a side note, conducting referendums on the disputed areas is almost entirely a stupid demand, considering that both the Sunni Arabs and Shia Arabs agree that the disputed areas should NOT fall into Kurdish hands. In fact, this may have been the reason why the Kurds militarily invaded some of those disputed regions, such as Kirkuk, as the Arabs resisted any attempt at a referendum in those regions. But I have a hard time thinking the Arabs will happily accept Kurdish military aggression, so if the Kurds is serious about negotiation, they might have to withdraw its forces from those disputed regions. TIME reports, however, that the Kurds are already in the process of ethnically cleansing the disputed areas[3]. So I think the Kurds are more interested in securing more territory for their state than they are in reaching a peace deal with Baghdad.\n \n Now the Sunnis would like the idea of strong federalism plan themselves, as they did not like the previous Maliki regime and wanted to contain it. So the Sunnis might be able to accept Kurdish demands if it would also help them gain their own \"de facto\" statelet. However, the Sunnis has just recently pulled out of talks with the Shia government following an attack on a major Sunni masjid[4]. The Sunnis believe that the the attack was orchestrated by Shia militants. Until the Sunnis return to the negotiating table, it's hard to see what sort of progress can be done in talks. In fact, if the Sunnis' allegations are true, then it's an important indication that the the Iraqi government CANNOT compromise with the Kurdistan, lest it upset its more militant elements.\n \n There's a possibility that some Sunni militants may rebel against the Islamic State on their own, without reconciling with the Iraqi government first, but such a rebellion may only lead to more chaos in the region, which would bolster the argument for Kurdish secession. Kurdistan would have protect themselves from all militants, IS or not.\n \n [1]http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/2014/08/18/-Soft-federation-is-Abadi-s-best-bet-to-keep-Kurds-within-Iraq.html\n [2]http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/30/world/middleeast/iraqi-kurds-expand-autonomy-as-isis-reorders-the-landscape.html\n [3]http://time.com/3182347/kurds-sunni-arabs-iraq-isis-erbil/\n [4]http://rt.com/news/182184-iraq-shia-sunni-shooting/",

It appears to be a red line that the Russians refuse to cross.\n \n That does not mean the Russians won't ever send in those troops.

Kiuchi, speaking to reporters after meeting with business leaders in Otsu, western Japan, also said that while it technically may be possible to double the central bank's government debt purchases, such a move would do more harm than good.

The results of the monthly Reuters Corporate Survey also showed broad support for the toughest economic policy decision Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to face in the year ahead - pushing ahead with a further sales-tax increase to 10 percent.   Too difficult a decision to take within 60 days, especially with a sales tax increase to come into effect  http://www.iii.co.uk/news-opinion/reuters/news/154960 http://www.iii.co.uk/news-opinion/reuters/news/154693",

Ocalan recently called for an end to a hunger strike by his supporters. To some, that suggests a deal has been made with the Turkish government. Even if true, a deal could relate to any of the demands that have been made on behalf of the Kurds. But of all those demands, Ocalan's release seems to be the least likely to be agreed to.    ",
        "In February, Moody's put the UK on \"negative outlook\", implying a 30% chance of losing its AAA credit rating within 18 months.   http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17021986  In March, Fitch changed its outlook to negative. This signalled a \"slightly greater than 50% chance\" that Britain would lose its AAA rating with Fitch in the next two years.  http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/apr/30/credit-ratings-country-fitch-moodys-standard  But S&P reaffirmed the UK's AAA rating in April and gave it a stable outlook (with no change to negative outlook since). At that time, S&P stated: \"We expect economic policy to focus on closing the fiscal gap, and we forecast the government's net debt burden to peak in 2013 [at about 87% of GDP].\"   http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17708678  So Fitch's and Moody's \"negative outlook\" means a 30% to 50+% chance of a downgrade in 18 to 24 months. S&P hasn't issued a negative outlook and isn't forecasting the UK's debt burden to peak until sometime in 2013 (perhaps suggesting no downgrade before then unless something major happens to cause it to alter its forecast).  Since the ending date of this question is April 1, 2013 (a little over 10 months from now), it seems to me that the probabilities attached to the Fitch and Moody \"negative outlooks,\" coupled with S&P's stable outlook, argue against the UK's credit rating being downgraded within the timeframe of this question. If S&P issues a negative outlook, I may change my mind.",

So a late November (or earlier) referendum is theoretically possible.\n \n Barzani (?) has asserted \"both\" (?) referenda will be held in 2014. The article above mentions a \"referendum on disputed areas\" to be followed by a \"general referendum . . . for independence.\" Not sure from reading More Info whether the \"referendum on disputed areas\" (sounds like it would include areas other than Kirkuk) would count to resolve this question. If it doesn't, there would be a time lag until the general referendum on independence is held -- another 30 days or so? Late December or even into January.\n \n Of course, there are factors in play that work against the conduct of the referendum. And my general guideline is that these things usually take longer than anticipated. And talk of a referendum may just be a bargaining ploy. On the other hand, the Kurds seem strongly motivated and the current state in Iraq provides an opportunity.\n \n So the progress on this matter needs to be watched. How quickly the electoral commission is formed may give us a clue.",

The prosecutor claimed that Ukraine incurred a loss of some $190 million to its budget as a result of the deal.\n\n\n\nThe trial began in June 2011. It is currently adjourned until 11 October, at which time a verdict is anticipated.\n\n\n\nThe trial is considered political and the independence of the Ukrainian judiciary is weak (Global Integrity's 2009 scorecard for Ukraine gave the lowest possible score in response to the question '80b. In practice, national-level judges are protected from political interference.'). Tymoschenko is an key opposition figure and a possible sentence of 7 years imprisonment would effectively sideline her from future attempts at office.\n\n\n\nFactors against a guilty verdict include: \n\n- diplomatic pressure from the US and the EU, and indications from the EU that a guilty verdict will negatively impact Ukraine's bid to join the EU.\n\n- domestic splits and the risk that T will become a martyr figure.\n\n- any concerns that Y will establish a precedent of prosecuting former leaders, to which he could eventually fall prey.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian Parliament will consider on 5 October whether to include the decriminalisation of the relevant articles on its forward agenda. Even if they do, it will be months before the articles are changed. Critically, Moenen's link (http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&listid=153933) notes that the likely condition for 'cancellation' of criminal punishment is that the damages are repaid - estimated by the prosecutor at $190 million. \n\n\n\nY could appease the EU by (eventually) removing criminal punishment for T and simultaneously destroy T's monetary capacity to run for future office by obliging her to repay $190 million before she can run again. \n\n\n\nThe timing and motivation for a guilty verdict are good.

        "Definitely maybe. It's hard to have much insight into the DPRK regime.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand:\n\n- DPRK attacked ROK twice in 2010 - sinking the Cheonan in March and bombarding Big Yeonpyeong island in November. ROK response was measured.\n\n- KJU was announced as successor in September 2010, and made a 4 star general. KJU was implicated in the Big Yeonpyeong bombardment, presumably to bolster his credentials as successor.\n\n- DPRK is an isolationist regime but uses the threat of external attack as a unifying force. The military is central to the regime. A small military excursion against ROK could be used to shore up the new leader or by generals to assert the role of the military in the new regime (either under the umbrella of the Kim dynasty or outside it).\n\n- ROK clearly considers this a risk - it put its military on alert following news of the death of KJI.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n- KJU was educated overseas and is considered by a few (very few) to be a potential reformer.\n\n- DPRK and ROK relations have generally improved over the past decade, the recent attacks notwithstanding. Regime change is a good opportunity to cement some of those gains.\n\n- China will be looking for a stable DPRK, as KJI proved a troublesome 'ally'\n\n\n\nOn balance, 'fired on' is so broad, ROK responses to recent attacks has proved so measured, and the importance of an assertive act by the DPRK military make this more likely than not.\n\n\n\n",
        "Papademos is Prime Minister in a coaltion government of three parties.\n\n\n\nElections are tentatively scheduled for early February 2012.

I've read up a little bit, and here's what I can add:  The fact that the the Hindu-nationalist BJP is in the process of unseating the liberal Congress party is an indication that India is, to some degree, swinging in an anti-Muslim direction these days. Though this is indirect, it would seem to indicate India being less likely to join the Muslim countries in a voting block defending Sri Lanka.   There seems to be discussion of a \"counter proposal\" being raised by the more autocratic nations in the UNHRC, and its unclear what this would entail precisely. But it seems to be some sort of watered down version of the main proposal, possibly saying that both sides of the war need to be investigated equally. This would still seem to fit the criteria for a positive response. I imagine if something passes it would probably be a compromise.

        "This is one of the most esoteric questions I have seen since the start of GJP. VSTOXX is a kind of \"volatility index\" measuring the variance in prices of stock options in the 50 European blue-chip stocks in the EURO STOXX 50 index. So this is, in a sense, two levels removed from the actual trading prices of the stocks. Presumably this index would increase when there was a lot of uncertainty in the markets, or when people were expecting large swings. But there are too many possible events, especially over the long time scale, to sensibly be able to predict this from actual causes. I think only a base-rate prediction is possible here.\n \n The chart (on the More Info site) shows that it has only reached the level of 23 twice this year, once for two days in early February and once for a single day in March. It also closed at this level one day last October, and two other times that year. If we go back further, in 2011 it reached the low 50s and was above 23 for an extended period. But the behavior since the start of 2013 looks most consistent, and also the calmest and lowest of values of this index on record. It's been just over 6 months since the last close above 23, but every period of 223 days since the start of 2013 has had a close over 23, and the time before that was even more volatile, so the base rate is 100%.\n \n I'm not actually going above 80% because it's just too random a thing to rely on. Later, assuming it does not reach this level and close early, I may reduce this score if it seems like it is staying far from 23 (or increase it if it seems more likely to hit it).",
        "North Korea is a joke, often making ludicrous claims about their capabilities. However, they do have missiles and rockets of a sort, though they seem rather less reliable than those in use by other countries. But North Korea is a real wildcard. Their actions sometimes defy logic. It's hard to say whether South Korean deployment of THAAD would make North Korea more likely to test a launch, as a show of bravado, or less likely due to the fear of failure, but I'm leaning slightly toward more likely.\n \n Note that the resolution criteria for the question define \"long-range\" as capable of reaching the continental United States, Alaska, or Hawaii. However, in addition to actual missile tests, they also include launches of rockets for launching satellites, since anything reaching orbit is deemed capable of reaching around the world. Since their 2012 satellite tests were deemed by many countries to violate a ban on North Korean ballistic missile tests, this is a reasonable stance. This makes the event somewhat more likely than it might be otherwise.\n \n Among North Korea's several missile tests, only one, the one in 2006, was of a missile meeting the resolution criteria.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_missile_tests\n \n They have also had 4 satellite launches which qualify, in 1998, 2009, and two in 2012.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwangmy%C5%8Fngs%C5%8Fng-3_Unit_2\n And see the links at the end of this article for other satellite launches.\n \n Since they have had a qualifying launch in one out of every three years in recent times, I'm putting this chance at about 1/3, slightly more likely due to not having any in the last year and a half.",

Crimea alone, with all its buildings and infrastructure intact, has already put a lot of stress on Russian economy. Adding something several times larger would likely be unmanageable.

        "Starting out at 24% with an upward bias. \n \n It only has to touch 1200 between now and then, which is a higher probably than merely closing below that level on October 31. US equities often sell off in September and early October, then bottom out and be positive for the month, per Brandon's point. In the next few days I'll adapt an old spreadsheet for the Topix and see if that pattern holds in Japan and report back. I'm also thinking the odds are high for another significant correction in stocks generally in the next couple of months. \n \n To start, I'm going with the options markets, which according to Bloomberg has a 24% probability that an American style put option will hit a strike of 1200 by October 31. The caveat is that those calculations are way out of my usual neighborhood haunts so I've reached out to a trader to make sure I'm reading the numbers right. \n \n \n \n ",

In January 2013, when the IMF started forecasting 2014, they had 4.1% and have revised down in nearly all of the subsequent quarterly updates. We'll get the January update within the next few weeks, and that might seal the deal. \n \n Brandon raises a great point about the drag from Russia's economy since the IMF's last update in October. But Russia's just 3% of global GDP, compared to 19% for the US and where growth has been coming in stronger. But then the EU, Japan, and China have been softer.\n \n As a quick and dirty proxy, I've plotted the consensus tracked by Bloomberg against the IMF's forecasts. They have different methodologies but it's the trend that matters. Over the past few months, the consensus has drifted mostly sideways with a small but perceptible downward tilt, supporting high odds that the IMF drops its forecast. \n \n ",

Russia's economy is all but in recession, the country is now engaged in de facto war, and another round of sanctions looms that will surely bite even more deeply than what we've seen so far. Altogether, I expect to move the odds higher. If events simmer down and/or the ruble shows some strength, I'll default back to the futures.",
        "Starting on the lower end with a bias to go lower.\n \n The last time OPEC cuts quotas was in 2008, and every six months there's rumbings that they will make cuts (the did boost when Iraq rejoined the fold in 2012). Instead, a lot of them keep overproducing. They haven't even been able to agree on a replacement general secretary since 2012. Discipline in OPEC isn't what it used to be.\n http://online.wsj.com/articles/opec-ministers-agree-to-maintain-output-quota-1402485387\n \n IEA says it expects no cuts. Saudi Arabia is signaling it will again resist cuts and is ok with lower prices, at least officially. Instead, partly to counter new competition from Nigeria in Asia (which now exports zero to the US), among others, Saudi Arabia unilaterally cut prices last month and Iran followed suit this month.\n http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/58d6d65a-537a-11e4-929b-00144feab7de.html\n http://www.nasdaq.com/article/crude-falls-as-opec-seen-leaving-quotas-unchanged-cm401478\n http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4355edac-53ac-11e4-8285-00144feab7de.html\n \n Consumption growth looks to be sluggish lately but I think the bigger driver in the price plunge is more supply. US is at multi-decade highs, upending global oil markets. OPEC is highest in a year. Supply disruptions have eased, notably from Libya. There's also a feedback effect from the stronger dollar: most commodities are priced in dollars, so stronger USD means weaker commodity prices.\n \n I've seen a few theories about what the Saudis are up to: undercut North American shale oil fracking/oil sands (unpersuasive methinks), put pressure on Russia (a fringe benefit), or strongarm other OPEC countries and secure market share (my vote).\n \n According to the IEA, 98% of US fracking is still profitable at $80 (dropping to 82% at $60). OPEC members have much lower production costs (around $20) but rely on oil to fund their social spending. The fiscal breakeven varies a lot. Saudi Arabia's is around $93 but apparently they can take $80. But fiscal breakeven for most all of OPEC is above current prices, with Iran at $140. Venezuela is at $121 and just called for an emergency OPEC meeting lest there be a price war. Meanwhile, Russia was at $117 even before the sanctions and higher social outlays.\n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/13/us-shaleoil-energy-breakeven-idUSKCN0I21GG20141013\n http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/15/opec-budget-idUKL6N0QL1VY20140815\n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/15/us-markets-oil-production-analysis-idUSKCN0I40CP20141015\n http://www.platts.com/latest-news/oil/london/saudis-boost-output-as-oil-price-slumps-venezuela-21377026\n http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-14/russia-must-cut-break-even-oil-price-to-80-citigroup-says-2-.html\n \n So I suspect what we're seeing is the fallout from ongoing internecine battles with OPEC. It'll be worth watching for any signs that they can agree on a replacement general secretary. If they can do that, then maybe the odds of quota cuts go up. \n \n My best guess is also that we're near the lows for oil anyway. Even a modest rise will reduce the pressure for quota cuts. \n ",
        "Thanks Kogo for great spadework! (I've got shovels on the brain these days.)\n \n I think you've nailed: according to this analyst, the next SDR structure is to be decided by the end of next year. That analyst concludes that \"Chinese measures over the past three years to liberalize and internationalize its currency, and a big increase in financial market interest in China, are pointing toward a broadening of the SDR's composition from January 2016.\" No doubt other sources are out there saying similar things. http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/10/07/china-currency-push/16852193/\n \n So I second Kogo's proposal that we can set aside the question of whether China will be added and focus on when the meeting will take place. As Kogo already found, they tend to meet in the fourth quarter.\n \n From the IMF website: \"The basket composition is reviewed every five years by the Executive Board, or earlier if the IMF finds changed circumstances warrant an earlier review.\" It also says that the \"next review will take place by 2015.\" But that's probably a typo. I'm sure they meant \"around\" 2015, by which I mean \"in\" 2015. (OK, I'll drop the peak carbon jokes now.) At least, the Spanish and Russian versions both say \"in\" 2015 at the latest. http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/sdr.htm\n \n Since China is quietly lobbying for this, I doubt there will be a push for \"an earlier review,\" let alone that there would be one if China did push for it.",

        "Like Kogo says, it has touched 50 only once in its short history back to 2012 and has been otherwise pretty steady in a relatively tight range in the low 50s. In theory, the breakeven between expansion and contraction is 50. I've attached a chart of the services PMI along with the manufacturing PMI, which has been oscillating around 50. I'm thinking a better way to look at this is how much these indexes are deviating from the averages, so I've added those lines as well.\n \n Personally, I'm skeptical how much these purchasing manager surveys are reliable gauges of China's economy (the equivalent in the US, Europe, and elsewhere have far more variation over the same time period). Their short history make them even more dubious. So I think I'll extrapolate the recent trends and put low odds that this survey touches 50 in the next 4 reports. I'll start at 25 and plan on moving lower, depending on what you guys come up with and maybe what the next report shows. \n \n The calendar currently shows these dates for the upcoming releases: March 3, April 2, May 5, and June 2 (which is the reporting date for May, so the question should close then).\n ",

Finally, the new administration also has an interest in sending a clear message to China and Russia who frequently and increasingly have been invading Japan's airspace--this is particularly timely considering China's release of it's stealth jet last January.

        "Here are some first-look references. I view my estimate as conservative, allowing space for uncertainty over the year.  S&P reaffirmed the AAA rating for Britain recently with a clear statement - they thought the economy was worse than the government estimates, expected British government debt to peak at 90% of GDP in 2014, but that Britain's strong economy and stable government could handle that.  By contrast, S&P downgrades of the US and France were both linked to political uncertainties, and the S&P statements were very explicit - especially for the Eurozone.   Fitch gave Britain a negative rating, but they were also explicit - they saw a 50-50 chance of downgrading Britain by 2014. That seems consistent with a 25% chance by April 2013... and S&P is more favorable.    The downsides are: (i) a major depression in the Eurozone, which is Britain's main trading partner; or (ii) a downward spiral from excessive austerity - as described by Keynes and Paul Krugman; or (iii) an unexpected no-confidence in the British government, which is after all a Tory-Liberal coalition. These seem significant but unlikely - Britain's strong tradition of government stability, the lack of a wildly irresponsible opposition party; and, above all, its control of its own currency give it advantages over Europe and the U.S.  References: S&P on Britain: http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?articleType=HTML&assetID=1245332003526    S&P downgrade of France (for contrast) http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?articleType=HTML&assetID=1245327295020  Guardian report of Fitch negative outlook  http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/apr/30/credit-ratings-country-fitch-moodys-standard ",

It has varied between 50 and 54 oover last 3 years; seems to make a relative high and relative low every 6 months or so.  Last low was 50.00 in July; previous lows were 50.8 (Jan 2014) and 50.9 (April 2013);  major highs were 54.7 (Apr, 2012); 54.3 (March 2013); and 54.2 (Aug., 2014).  Currently 51.8 (Jan 2015).  A drop to near 50.0 over the next few months looks consistent with this pattern;  also with word of slowing Chinese economy; gov't will fight with stimulus measures.  The pattern suggests the next low near 50.0,; call it 50-50 whether it's below or not; but the next drop to near 50.00 may not occur in the next 4 months.

Not quite sure my reasoning is correct, but while I figure it out and await my friends' response I may as well share here.\n \n Volatility over one year is indeed 17.5%. However over a 69 day period (calculated this yesterday, using 49 trading days vs 252 total for a year) one sigma is 7.7%. That would make a drop from 1286 to 1200 a 0.86 sigma event, which Z-tables tell me sits 30% below mean. Add to that the 50% above mean (=closes above 1286) and this would indicate there is an 80% chance that the TOPIX will NOT close below 1200. All of this assumes, of course, that a market index follows a random walk from any given point, which for this short time period I think is reasonable. Over very long periods, indices tend to drift upwards, so the volatility is not quite symmetrical.\n \n What stumps me at this point, and what I asked my friend about, is whether it makes a difference that the index may drop below 1200 *on any given day* between now and close, i.e. it's not just one sample on 30 October.

        "I'm going to go for it on this one. The time frame is short, as the elections are scheduled for the 30th. I see very little concrete data, but the general feeling seems to be that the State of Law Coalition is expected to win the most seats.  The State of Law Coalition has the most seats right now, with 89:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Law_Coalition  Second is the Iraqi National Movement (or al-Iraqiyya), a secular coalition, currently at 83. It had 91 but lost 8 defectors to a new independent party:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_National_Movement  Rumor has it that the Iraqi National Movement is collapsing:  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26838755  \"Analysts say the strongest challenge to Mr Maliki's State of Law bloc next month is likely to come from rival Shia factions, rather than a large Sunni alliance.  \"The Iraqiyya bloc of former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, which won the most seats in the last general election in 2010, has largely fragmented into components led by various Sunni and other leaders.\"  The third-largest coalition is the National Iraqi Alliance, a Shia coalition with 70 seats:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Iraqi_Alliance  The Kurdistan List has 43. One source expects the Kurdish group to finish second:  [Same story that Brett linked to in his Forum post, but at a different site] http://www.aina.org/news/20140413132051.htm  \"The State of Law coalition headed by the current Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, along with its National Allied Coalition (Shiite), are likely to receive most of the votes. The Kurdish parties in the Iraqi Kurdistan region will come second, and the Sunni coalitions in the west and middle of Iraq will come in third. Currently, the National Allied Coalition will constitute the biggest bloc in parliament.\"  I have no idea what that means. Unless it is suggesting that the State of Law Coalition is allying with, or will ally with, the National Iraqi Alliance, the numbers don't add up.  Almost the same article, but with additional mentions of electoral irregularities:  http://www.aina.org/news/20140410143211.htm  \"There is another indication that the April results will be similar to those in 2010. By mid-March the High Commission for the Elections (HCE), the supposed independent body responsible for conducting and observing the elections, had only distributed four million out of 21 million voting cards for eligible voters (18%). Although the HCE claims that distribution has since increased, all available figures show the percentage could only jump to 30-35%. Furthermore, it is believed that the vast majority of those whodid receive their cards are members or supporters of the parties already participating in the political process. More damning still is the collective decision by the HCE's members to resign, on account of government pressure. Later they were forced to withdraw their resignations, again due to the prime minister's interference and control over the HCE (which is directly attached to his office, not to the process).  \"Furthermore, due to the high level of corruption, most of the parties taking part in the political process, and their members, have accumulated huge fortunes which enable them to bribe voters with ease in a country where the majority live in poverty.\"  Opinion piece that suggests that al-Maliki will win, and that that is not a good thing for Iraq's security:  http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2014/04/iraqs-elections-setting-worst-case-scenario/82390/  \"In hindsight, the image of Iraq that emerged from the hopeful 2010 national elections seems like a mirage.\"  \"As Iraqis prepare for another national election at the end of this month, an increasingly authoritarian Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his Shiite-led government appear poised to further consolidate power at the expense of Sunnis and Kurds.\"  Article suggesting that terrorist attacks against Sunnis are likely to depress the Sunni vote, thereby (indirectly) helping al-Maliki's coalition:  http://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/2014/04/16/elections-in-iraq-and-uncertainty  \"ISIL members are said to be distributing leaflets in Sunni-majority areas threatening the public not to participate in the elections. That is why many expect significant problems in participation in the elections.\"  All in all, everyone seems to think that al-Maliki's coalition will win, and given where we are in the season, I figure I might as well go for it on this one.",
        "Given our position this season, I'm just going to go for it on this one.\n \n From the articles in the More Info tab:\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2014/10/20/after-record-warm-september-2014-is-on-track-to-warmest-year-noaa-says/\n \n \"September was the warmest such month on record, according to the monthly climate report by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center.

And year to date, 2014 ties with 1998 and 2010 - two of the warmest years in recorded history - with a temperature departure of 1.22 degrees above average.\n \n \"\"If 2014 maintains this temperature departure from average for the remainder of the year, it will be the warmest year on record,\" says the report.\n \n \"While we still have three months to see whether the calendar year will set a record, the past 12 months - October 2013 through September 2014 - was the warmest 12-month period on record, at 1.24 degrees above the 20th century average temperature.\"\n \n http://www.climatecentral.org/news/2014-on-track-to-be-warmest-year-18205\n \n \"With the ocean warmth expected to continue and an El Nino event trying to form, that makes it likely that the final three months of the year will also be among the warmest. That would stand in contrast to 1998 and 2010, where the record warmth started to taper off at the end of both years, in part because El Ninos that were in place at the beginning of those years died down.\"\n \n \"The land area of the planet is perhaps the biggest unknown in the coming months because they change temperature more rapidly, but if the El Nino forms, that will stack the deck because during an El Nino \"you tend to have more warmth over land areas in general,\" Blunden said.\n \n \"The NCDC has worked out that if each of the remaining months of this year at least matches the average of its 10 warmest occurrences, then 2014 will be the warmest year on record.

On 14 February, ITAR-Tass and Interfax quoted General Yuri Baluyevsky, the Russian military's chief of general staff, as saying that Russia could pull out of the INF, and that the decision would depend on the United States' actions with its proposed Ground-Based Midcourse Defense missile defense system, parts of which the U.S. at the time planned to deploy in Poland and the Czech Republic (since then, the plans have been abandoned in favor of different systems based on sea and in Romania, see National missile defense).\"\n \n ...and the idea is not entirely illegitimate:\n \n \"Dan Blumenthal of the American Enterprise Institute has written that the actual Russian problem with the INF is that China is not bound by it and continues to build up their own Intermediate-Range forces.\"\n \n From the first link in the More Info tab, Russian compliance doesn't seem to be a big concern for the U.S.:\n \n [July 28]\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/world/europe/us-says-russia-tested-cruise-missile-in-violation-of-treaty.html\n \n \"The United States has concluded that Russia violated a landmark arms control treaty by testing a prohibited ground-launched cruise missile, according to senior American officials, a finding that was conveyed by President Obama to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in a letter on Monday.\"\n \n \"Russia first began testing the cruise missiles as early as 2008, according to American officials, and the Obama administration concluded by the end of 2011 that they were a compliance concern. In May 2013, Rose Gottemoeller, the State Department's senior arms control official, first raised the possibility of a violation with Russian officials.\"\n \n Taking years to respond suggests indifference.\n \n Russia may gain an advantage or two in remaining formally within the treaty:\n \n http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=123813\n \n \"The U.S. has engaged Russia, [Brian P.

I'm still looking for analysis indicating the extent of Sheikh Ahmed's role, but circumstantial evidence suggests he's a factor in negotiations to pull the various tribal leaders together - thus a guess that his continued presence might facilitate negotiations. There are also some indications that al-Shabaab has an uneasy relationship with its foreign al Qaeda allies, which provides some small potential that a portion of al-Shabaab will make a break and negotiate.   On the other side: the constitution is only the first step - a parliament must be selected, president elected, and reforms continued - a distraction from negotiations.

        "From wtonewsstand.com:\n \"Posted: November 17, 2014 This week promises to be a busy one for U.S. trade policy. Things kicked off with an effort by United States and European leaders to jump-start the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations by giving new political impetus to the talks, which have slowed in part due to the transition to a new European Commission. In a joint statement issued on Nov. 16 after their meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Australia, President Obama and EU leaders reaffirmed their commitment to \"comprehensive and ambitious negotiations, in a spirit of mutual benefit,\" leading to a high-standard TTIP agreement. That message could be aimed at responding to calls by some in the EU, such as European Parliament International Trade (INTA) Committee Chairman Bernd Lange, for both sides to scale back the scope of the negotiations. Notably, the joint statement did not call for the negotiations to be concluded in 2015, as EU heads-of-government have collectively called for, but merely directed negotiators \"to make all possible progress over the coming year.\" \n \n In sum, agreement by June is unlikely.  If the ISDS issue is resolved in advance, an interim announcement to that effect is also unlikely. The agreement is more likely to be presented as a complete package to limit parties' ability to cherry pick.  Even if announced, I don't believe ISDS isn't the only issue holding up the process, so I'm not predicting as wide a spread as my teammates at this point.

        "A small scale cross-border raid would invite tit-for-tat by the PDK/PKK, Hezbollah, etc., which Turkey wants to avoid, and it might not be felt as more than a military pin prick by Assad, who continually suffers similar setbacks from the less capable rebels.  In any case, Assad could later resume the shelling with even greater potential to goad Turkey into triggering Armageddon, so it seems the small-scale scenario should look like more trouble than it's worth to Turkey.  I think any November incursion would have to be designed as irresistible, and therefore accompanied by measures to suppress Syria's use of air power in the border area.  This would create a strong possibility of all-out war that would entail huge costs and ultimately leave Turkey / AL / NATO responsible for Syria's fate, which is why it isn't a realistic scenario.  Unfortunately, Assad could see goading Turkey into triggering just such an Armageddon as an attractive way to end the ongoing blame for his country's catastrophe, so there's some chance he'll manage it.  Of course, both Assad and Erdogan are all over this and at this point both are surely bluffing, so the most likely cause of a Yes resolution is obviously miscalculation.",

Though Republicans have repeatedly opposed the president over various policies, many party members support the TPP.\n \n Matthew Goodman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies also said there is a consensus over the trade policy between President Obama, who is concerned with his legacy, and Republicans, who long to achieve solid results before the next elections.\n http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001698912",

        "I agree with Paul and Devyn, but to shine some light on the long-shot opposing view, here's a significant push to cancel from Tom Friedman (NYT)l:\n \n From the op-ed:\n A Bad Mistake\n ...\n You know how this happened: Netanyahu; his ambassador; the pro-Israel lobby Aipac; Sheldon Adelson, the huge donor to Bibi and the G.O.P.; and Boehner all live in their own self-contained bubble. You can tell that nobody was inside there telling them: \"Bibi, this speech to Congress two weeks before your election may give you a sugar high for a day with Israeli voters, but it's in really poor taste for you to use America's Congress as a backdrop for your campaign. Many of Israel's friends will be uncomfortable, and the anti-Semites, who claim Israel controls Washington, will have a field day.\"\n \n Already, in reaction to this maneuver, 10 Senate Democrats - who had advocated putting more sanctions on Iran now - have instead parted company with the Republicans and granted the White House the two-month reprieve it was seeking to see if negotiations can still work. It was exactly the opposite of what Netanyahu wanted, and it shows how upset are many Democrats.\n \n But this isn't just churlish. For Israel's leader to so obviously throw his lot in with the Republicans against a Democratic president is reckless. Israel and its defenders are already under siege on college campuses across America, where many university boards are under pressure to divest from companies doing business with Israel. Making support for Israel more of a Republican cause is not at all in Israel's interest - or America's. Israel needs the support of more than just Congress or one party.\n ...\n ...if we do use force, success is hardly assured and the blowback unpredictable. That is why it is absolutely not in Israel's interest to give even the slightest appearance of nudging America toward such a military decision. Israel should stay a million miles away from that decision, making clear that it is entirely a U.S. matter. Because, if we do have to strike Iran, plenty of Americans will not be happy. And if it fails, or has costly consequences for us and our military, you can be sure a lot more Americans will not be happy - and some will ask, \"How did we get into this mess?\" One of the first things they'll dig out will be Netanyahu's speech to Congress.\n \n Why in the world would Israel risk putting itself in that situation? Just lie low, Mr. Netanyahu. Don't play in our politics. Let America draw its own conclusions.\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/opinion/thomas-friedman-a-bad-mistake.html?emc=edit_th_20150204&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=62582784&_r=0",

I'll make a wild guess that the chance of it being imported to any other EU country is 5%.  Combined that means the chance of it being imported to the EU (ignoring all other EU countries!) was 41% = 1 - (1-.25)*(1-.10)*(1-.05)*(1-.03)*(1-.05).\n \n What are the chances an imported infection will not be confirmed to have started in West Africa even though it had and what are the chances any case will be transmitted within the EU (the question's resolution criteria)?  Note that if a case is imported from a non-West African country, it would count.  I'm going to be conservative and make a wild guess of 10%, so the chance of a qualifying case by 9/21 might be 4.1% = .41*.10.\n \n Do any of you have or can find information about what the chance of it spreading is so I can improve my 10% guess?\n \n If there's a 4.1% chance per month and a little over 8 months to go, the chance is 72% = (1-0.041)**8.\n \n How might things change?  What more will the world do to stop the outbreak?  Will travel from infected regions to Africa be cut further?  Will Europe start screening arriving people more?  What?\n \n I should reduce the 72% because I'd guess things will get worse slower than the article projected for September due to international fears, but I kind'a think my 10% is low, so I'll stick with 72% as my baseline and use the Playground to bump it.",

The graph is moving upwards (I know this is no guarantee that it will continue to do so), but once someone has become a refugee, I suspect they are not going to change their status until: a. the situation at home improves, or b. the situation in the place they are a refugee deteriorates.  I think it is unlikely that Syria will improve much in the medium term, and I think provision for refugees is likely to stay the same or improve in some places, as the international community realises the only thing it can really do effectively is care for the refugees.    Also, with the UN trying to drive for a solution, mounting refugee figures are in its interest.  It collects the data, and so it has an incentive to count generously.  Additionally, the countries bearing the brunt of the refugee influx will not want to shoulder this burden alone, and will want international help (i.e. money), they may also be prone to exaggerating numbers.  I am not saying the counting of refugees in this context is deliberately disingenuous, but there is a strong incentive not to under count (unlike in some other situations).  As for historical data on refugees, I know in Iraq, there were alleged to be perhaps 2 million refugees (which is around 7ish% of the population I think).  I would rate the intensity of the Syrian conflict as below that in Iraq, but not by a huge margin.  Imagining a reasonable correlation between conflict intensity and number of refugees (factoring in variables like ease of escape, economic mobility etc.), I reckon 250k for Syria sounds definitely feasible.",

I note they left the port of Marko, without much of a fight (and this was apparently important to them for revenue reasons), but without understanding the importance of Kismayo, it is difficult to call.  If they leave without much of a fight, it could end in a matter of days.  If there is a prolonged struggle, or government/Kenyan will starts to erode, then it could take longer or not happen at all.

        "I believe that Iran's blockading of the strait is more or less dependent on the occurrence of a foreign kinetic attack or invasion (in line with a previous question).  There are some circumstances where they may seek to blockade the strait in the absence of such an attack, such as severe non-kinetic provocation (e.g. regime threatening sanctions or other diplomatic activity, significant and aggressive backing of anti-regime proxies or other non-kinetic activities) or widespread internal unrest.  But, I believe their occurrence and Iran's subsequent response to blockade the strait, would be unlikely.  So to all intents and purposes, I see a foreign kinetic attack, or its imminent threat as a \"necessary condition\" for a strait blockade, but not a \"sufficient condition\" - i.e. there are scenarios where such an attack occurs, but Iran does not respond by blockading the strait.  Therefore as I see it, we must consider the following factors: 1. the probability of an attack on Iran; 2. if 1, then the probability that Iran would respond by blockading the strait; and 3. if 1 and 2, the probability that Iran would be successful in blockading the strait.  When you consider the probability of the coincidence of all these factors, to my mind, it lowers my perception of the probability of a yes.  Accepting that the timescale is quite far out for this question, and the need to include some wiggle room for a strait closure in the absence of an attack (as mentioned in my first paragraph).  I have come up with the following forecast.  This all sounds a little bit more scientific than it actually was, which as usual for me involves a little bit of structured thinking, followed by a wet finger in the air.",
        "I caveat this assessment with the fact that I know very little about Chinese politics, but I think the Chinese Communist Party may have realised that prosecuting senior members for corruption is actually a way of reinforcing it's legitimacy (provided the corruption can be shown to be isolated).  I don't think it will want another case so close to the Bo Xilai case because it would reflect badly on it, but if an accusation arises that gains public awareness (perhaps through international exposure) then I think they will be left with little choice but to act.  I think their ability to ignore such a case becomes more limited if the economy is not doing quite so well (although most countries can only dream of anything approaching 7.5%).  So I think a yes becomes more likely with this precondition.  The following articles are quite interesting.  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3b3a5c50-25d8-11e3-aee8-00144feab7de.html#axzz2gAMZsyae  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/world/asia/with-officials-conviction-china-calls-attention-to-graft-crackdown.html?_r=0  They seem to suggest that the corruption crackdown is partly about President Xi establishing himself as a leader of integrity.  I think in this context another arrest becomes quite likely. ",

        "Base Rate:  According to World Bank data, Japan's defence spending has pretty much adhered to the 1% convention established in the 70s.  So in baseline terms there is no real precedent for this.  However, at some point in the future Japan will spend more than 1% as the convention is unlikely to last forever, but will it be this year?    There has been a lot of coverage about heightened tensions, which increases the probability of a yes, but the starting baseline probability is very low.  Additionally, GDP is set to grow, so Japan could increase absolute defence spending without breaking the 1% ceiling.  The question relates to the draft budget, so it is possible that it might be used to \"kite fly\" the idea and test public opinion before taking the actual decision, But I don't think this is how the draft budget is used in Japan.  I have factored into my score the risk that for some reason there is an unintentional exceeding of the 1%, because of some discrepancy in spending and forecast GDP.",
        "There are two significant barriers to this happening: the first will be Syrian regime obfuscation; the second is the lack of security in Syria.  Both will make the job of the OPCW very difficult within this timeframe.  And at this stage we don't even have agreement from all parties that the OPCW will be allowed into the country to attempt this.    One of the factors that would make this outcome more likely is clear and broad international consensus.  The precondition for this question states no UNSCR on Syria, this is suggestive of a lower level of consensus (although a UNSCR is by no means the only mechanism for demonstrating consensus).  Further counting against the likelihood of this scenario is the apparent reduction in the threat of US led military strikes against the regime.    Call me a pessimist, but I'm afraid I can't really see an OPCW mission being agreed, the Syrian regime and the Russians accepting the terms of this mission and the mission embarking and carrying out all of its work before the end of the year in a country in the grips of a full scale civil war, especially not in the absence of a UNSCR.",
        "1. The futures prices (as presented on Wingender's link) now appear to be around $70.50 per ton in December 2014.  (I am unclear whether this is for a delivery at the end of the month or the beginning.)\n \n 2. The basic driver for the recent collapse in iron ore prices is decreased demand for housing in China.  I do not see that trend reversing itself over the next month. Economic growth in China is slowing, and in particular data this week indicates hoe prices are continuing to fall (see http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-18/iron-ore-bear-market-deepens-as-china-home-data-add-to-concern.html).  Citigroup is estimating iron ore prices could fall to as low as $60/ton next year.\n \n 3. Media reports say that the spot price of iron ore closed at around $72.10/ton on 18 November.  (See http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-19/iron-ore-price-slumps-to-new-five-year-low/5902044).  A fall of an additional dollar per ton is negligble in this context, and as noted above, the drivers are driving the price downward.\n \n I am having trouble finding the spot price for iron ore online, including on Bloomberg, so I am relying on the media reports. Does anyone have a link to spot (as opposed to futures) prices?",
        "I'm not a big fan of technical analysis of stock markets, but GJP asks us to look at comparison classes, so I started off by looking at price volatility on TOPIX from January 2012 to the present.  TOPIX closed at 1286 today, according to Bloomberg, so this question is asking how likely an 80-point drop is in the next 2+ months.  (For the sake of simplicity, I'll call this a quarter.) Since 2012, TOPIX suffered an 80-point drop in 4 quarters and no such drop in 6. Assuming the global and regional macroeconomic environment stays constant (i.e., modest improvement) show, which I think is likely, and assuming no political crisis with China or North Korea, that indicates a 40% chance it will close below 1200 during the period in question.\n \n Now, as I noted above, I dislike technical analysis.  (The above is also very much a seat-of-the-pants analysis.) I prefer thinking in terms of market fundamentals. My own feeling is that the US mini-correction of late July is over, and that fundamentals are reasonably strong, so I am bullish on the next two months.  Let's say a 80% chance of continued increases, or at least of minor decreases less than 80 points. I'd adjust that downward slightly to compensate for black swan geopolitical events, earthquakes in Japan, etc.  Call it a 25% chance of an 80-point drop.",
        "1. We already have one comparison class: Thomas Eric Duncan. We've learned from him that we cannot rely on travelers to be honest at airport/customs checks about their medical and travel histories.  It appears that Duncan lied to officials about his exposure history when leaving Liberia, and indeed the Liberian president has threatened to prosecute him for this.  Indeed, there have been suggestions that Duncan knew there was a good chance he was infected, and deliberately traveled to the US so as to be in a position to receive superior treatment in the event he became symptomatic. \n \n 2. There are many more commercial flights between West Africa and Europe than between West Africa and America.  (Note that Duncan himself flew to the US via Brussels.)  With the possible exception of Liberia, West African countries have closer cultural ties to Europe than North America.  That means that someone who fears exposure but has the means to travel to the West before becoming symptomatic to seek treatment, is more likely to go to Europe than the US.  European countries are also more likely to render treatment at low cost, thanks to national health care systems. All this means that Europe may be a magnet for future Mr. Duncans.\n \n 3. Western countries have (inexplicably) shown little desire to restrict entry by persons with visas issued in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, or whose trips originate from those countries.  (And yes, it should be possible for Homeland Security to know the origin of airline passengers who change planes at hubs.)  The doors are open.\n \n 4. Then there is the issue of European medical personnel and journalists returning home. As we know, several American aid workers, and an NBC cameraman, caught Ebola in Africa.  They were also diagnosed in Africa, which does not count towards this question.  But supposed a European aid worker contracts Ebola just before leaving, and only becomes symptomatic once home?\n \n While the initial response from the Dallas emergency rooms and hazmat teams has been keystone cops-ish, this will probably improve somewhat; so I do agree with Lift that a full-fledged outbreak in the EU is unlikely.",
        "Russia has been reluctant to intervene directly thus far and has relied on proxies, paramilitary personnel, etc. I suspect this is because Putin has been unwilling to risk the total isolation an outright invasion would bring. (That was also the reason the Russian military stopped 40km from Tbilisi in 2008.)  In addition, Putin knows that there would be significant casualties from an outright invasion, as well as asymmetric warfare a la Gaza.\n \n However, the Ukranians have had a surprising amount of success counteracting these proxies in Lugansk and Donetsk, which will force Putin to make a choice: intervene more directly (and the aid convoy is an example of this) or concede that that Ukrainians have won and withdraw. The latter course would be too humiliating and might cast doubt on his continued leadership of Russia, so I expect some kind of escalation.\n \n The aid convoy appears to be an attempt to escalate without resorting to an open invasion, as does alleged artillery shelling from Russia. (I would also note that some of the paramilitaries are likely Russian regular military who have removed their insignia.)\n \n There is also a point where Putin will reason that the sanctions have been imposed, public opinion in Germany has turned against him, and he has little to lose by going for broke.  And the threat of asymmetric warfare ultimately did not deter him in Chechnya.\n ",
        "1. This question has a long time frame.\n \n 2. The chances of a meeting with the G7 or South Korea are close to nil. But Russia and China are more likely. According to 38 North (http://38north.org/2014/05/avorontsov050814), the Russian Presidential Representative for the Far East District (this is a post that reports directly to Putin) visited North Korea in late April -- \"the first time in the last 30 years-since 1985-that a top deputy in the Russian government has visited North Korea.\" There have been a variety of lower-level meetings, including at Sochi and a visit by Tatarstan's president, Rustem Minnikhanov (who is something of a bellweather) to Pyongyang.\n \n The 38 North article also correctly notes that the ever-increasing Western sanctions on Russia will draw Moscow and Pyuongyang closer together. It would be a typical Putin move to thumb his nose at the West by meeting Kim Jong-Un.\n \n 3. Xi Jinping visited South Korea in July, in what was perceived as a rebuff to North Korea and displeasure with Kim. However, the media couched this as \"visiting the South BEFORE the North,\" not \"visiting the South in lieu of the North.\" I ultimately doubt that China will want to tilt completely in favor of the South.",
        "This question is largely best rephrased as, \"will India sign the TFA\"? So to begin with, I will say that if India signs, there's a 95% chance the remaining objectors (Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, etc. will sign).  Note also that the TFA could de facto be ratified as a plurilateral agreement (i.e., between many, but not all, WTO members) without India's support.\n \n India's objections center on food security, which is a hot-button issue in India. Other countries will undoubtedly place a significant amount of pressure on India to sign. Narendra Modi is perceived to be an economic liberalizer and built his reputation on attracting FDI to Gujarat. However, even liberalizers need to pick their battles, and the agriculture lobby is strong in many, many places (e.g., the US, Japan, EU), and that is not necessarily the first lobby he would want to take on. Other areas of liberalization are lower-hanging fruit.  \n \n The Hufbauer interview (http://www.dw.de/indias-resistance-to-key-trade-agreement-deals-major-blow-to-wto/a-17825540) does a good job of framing these issues.  It does suggest several concessions that might make the agriculture issue tolerable to India.  Several days ago, however, India also declined to sign the Asean Services and Investment Agreement. This suggests that Modi is signalling he won't agree to this compromise soon.\n \n Finally, there is the lingering failure to conclude the Doha ROund.\n \n So, I would put the chance of ratification at 20% if there is no change in WTO food subsidy rules. I do think that if the WTO food subsidy rules get reformed - such that the cap gets lifted above 10% of total grain production, or such that reference prices get calculated according to a more recent year than 1986 -- the chances increase greatly. Modi told Nick Clegg (http://www.livemint.com/Politics/P4daJEnG5ORnWQDuj4MYAM/Food-security-should-not-be-sole-reason-for-stopping-WTO-dea.html) that India's sole concern was the food subsidy regime.",

The time scale for past fluctuations has been on the order of a few weeks, so we should have ample warning of a sourcing forecast.\n \n I'll forecast high and adjust strongly as we get closer to deadline.",
        "Okay, I guess I'm the team data guy...\n \n OVX last closed above 25 almost exactly a year ago.  Prior to January 2013 the price was consistently above 25, dating back to the inception of the index in 2007.  Thus the currently low values are a long-term historical anomaly, presumably brought about by the decreased US military actions in the Middle East.  ISIS might upset that trend, however.\n \n In 2013, there were roughly 4 periods that pushed the OVX above 25, so the base rate since Jan 2013 is 4 events per 21 months, or 1 event every 5 months or so.  This question is open for more than 8 months.  \n \n Therefore, base rate analysis, past history and current political events all argue that a 'yes' answer is quite probable.  Will forecast on that side, but conservatively in light the fact that this is highly volatile and I don't know what I'm talking about.",

I got burned on this last season when a clearly imminent invasion never materialized.\n \n There's a relatively short time frame and civilian casualties don't count.

With that in mind, I'll forecast on the low side, but hedge my bets quite bit.  Watch closely.",

In exchange, the Turkish government would require the active participation of the US-led coalition in bringing down the Assad government.  Since the U.S. is determined to abstain from potentially decisive direct armed participation in Syria's civil war, the current stand-off between the US and Turkey is likely to continue.  The two positions are distinct because of the limiting conditions set by the U.S  The Obama administration is determined to limit its combat to the key enemy--the Islamic State.

        "In a recent issue, The Economist reviews The South China Sea: The Struggle for Power in Asia by Bill Hayton, a journalist for the BBC. The Economist's reviewer writes:\n \n <blockquote>Most alarming is the fact that the sea has become the theatre for a battle of nerves between China and America. China believes America is encouraging the littoral states to stand up to it over its territorial claims, and bitterly resents America's insistence that it has the right to send its spy ships to the edge of China's territorial waters, 22km off its coast. American power depends on the freedom of navigation, both for its navy and for commercial traffic through the sea. The South China Sea has become the test of America's strategic \"rebalancing\" towards Asia and of its willingness to protect its friends and allies from Chinese bullying. As Mr Hayton sombrely notes: <b>\"The logic is towards conflict.\"</b>\n \n The author adds, however, that in the final stage of his research he changed his mind. When Mr Hayton began working on his book, he believed that some kind of conflict over the sea was imminent. He subsequently became convinced that Chinese leaders understand they would lose a shooting war and are desperate to avoid it, using instead what they call \"the period of strategic opportunity\" to build up China's strength. Since they know the other side must grasp this, however, they have to appear belligerent. This is an intriguing argument. But <b>this strategy is so vulnerable to miscalculation, misperception and sheer bad luck, that it is not a very reassuring one</b>. [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n \n It looks to be a toss-up.",

Three countries are currently part of MAP (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Montenegro), and these three countries received their invitations to join MAP in 1999, 2009, and 2010 respectively [1][2].\n \n I agree wholeheartedly with the 'Countries where current policy favors NATO membership' table from Wikipedia, which shows the steps which countries take before being invited to MAP and lists the two non-MAP countries which have completed some of those steps and have, at various points, expressed interest in joining NATO (Ukraine and Georgia) [2].\n \n This gets us to two interesting question. First, will Ukraine or Georgia receive an invitation to join MAP. Given the immense pressure that Russia is exerting on these two countries, I think the answer is clearly no. If Ukraine makes another move toward NATO or EU membership, Russia will invade more of Ukraine and continue to decimate Ukraine's infrastructure and make Ukraine an even more politically and financially unstable countries. Georgia is the perfect of example of a time when this actually happened, and we can see that Georgia responded to Russia's threats by not moving forward to the MAP step of joining NATO [3]. There is a lot of uncertainty when it comes to Ukraine and Georgia. Obama and NATO might decide to 'stick it to Putin' and advance Ukraine or Georgia to the MAP stage very quickly, but I expect a slow detante from the current state of affairs in the former Soviet Union with the U.S. and NATO uninterested in causing instability by offering Georgia or Ukraine a roadmap to NATO membership.\n \n Now we have to ask if any country besides for Georgia and Ukraine might seek an invitation to MAP. Given that no country has sought such an invitation since 2010, I am leaning toward a 'no' here, but this is why I am answering with a 32% as opposed to a 10%.

        "Khamenei and Rouhani seem to have a pretty good working relationship. Khamenei appears to trust Rouhani to handle the negotiations, and Rouhani knows his boss well enough not to negotiate (or let his Foreign Minister negotiate) an agreement that Khamenei wouldn't support. Control over nuclear research and development lies with the IRGC, which is outside Rouhani's control, but Khamenei is keeping the IRGC in line. As long as the Iranians believe they can get a deal with the P5+1 that allows them some enrichment, I think they'll negotiate with the IAEA in good faith and follow through on their commitments. I don't think anything will happen in the next month to shake the Iranians' faith in a successful negotiation.  Note also that the Gchine visit is one of the easier steps for the Iranians to take. The IAEA will be asking them to take more difficult steps as negotiations proceed.  I'm estimating that there's a 5% probability that the US Senate will signal in the next month that it won't ratify an agreement that allows Iran any enrichment. Add another 5% for unknown unknowns that could scuttle Iranian faith in the process, and that adds up to a 10% chance of something happening that would make the Iranians uncooperative. Or to state the obverse, there's a 90% chance of the Iranians allowing the IAEA into Gchine by Feb. 11.",
        "Long analysis posted in forum. Short analysis: Both attempts that Yanukovych has made to suppress the protests have only strengthened them. Under a State of Emergency, Yanukovych can't be sure that the police and military would follow orders. The oligarchs think Yanukovych already has too much power and are more concerned with restoring order than saving his presidency. An SoE will be ruled out by the conditions that the EU and US set if Yanukovych accepts their help. Russian aid doesn't place such restrictions, but Yanukovych and Putin have a very poor personal relationship and it's not certain that Putin will be willing to supply all the aid that he and Yanukovych previously agreed on. The risks of an SoE seem to outweigh the benefits to Yanukovych.",

Furthermore, the multiday incubation period would make it just as easy for an infected individual to board a plane to Europe as it was to fly to the US. The large number of European aid workers, such as those involved with MSF, who are currently on-the-ground, as well as significant trade links, results in a high risk that at least one confirmed case of Ebola will emerge in the next eight months. The only \"wildcard\" which might avoid this outcome is a massive global response complete with total travel bans and intrusive disease monitoring which I see no chance of occurring unless the disease becomes globally rampant, and even by that time, at least one European case would probably occur. \n \n Unless there is a significant shift in the response to the epidemic, I don't forsee myself adjusting my prediction downward until sometime easly next year.

More recent polling suggests Rousseff is running in the 36-39% range, a plurality, but far less than the absolute majority she will need to avoid a runoff. Neves has been running in the low 20% range. After Eduardo Campos died in a plane crash, his running mate and replacement saw a huge spike in the polls to 21%. This is probably just an effect of the coverage of the crash, but the jump for the PSB doesn't correspond with any decline in support for the PT or PSDB, so it might actually show a consolidation of 3rd party supporters around a single candidate.

        "Thanks Ayusevic for starting.  Here's my analysis, expanding a bit on yours.\n \n (1) on the STOXX site \n http://www.stoxx.com/indices/index_information.html?symbol=V2TX \n the charts to pay attention to are the 1-year and the \"max\" (back to 2000).  For both theory and practical reasons the index is never going to go very low (the past running minimum was around 14) but can go very high.  The past pattern has been a \"baseline\" varying slowly over a range 15-25, with upward \"shocks\" of length 1 month (smaller up-jumps) to 1 year (larger up-jumps).\n (2) The argument for \"no\" is that since 2013 we have been in a \"low baseline\" period which from history can be expected to last at least another year, and the most recent (August) \"shock\" was too small to break the 23 barrier.\n (3) The argument for \"yes\" is that 3 shocks over the last 12 months (October, February, March) did just break the 23 barrier, so another such during the next 8 months can't be so unlikely, even if the underlying \"baseline\" remains low.  And there's the extra chance that the baseline doesn't remain low.\n \n So I'm going to start with 70% intending to reduce by 10% per month unless the index increases to 19.",

        " Another question that no-one else has tackled, so let me make a start.\n \n (1) Here is the Chinese comment quoted in the July 15 NYT article whose link is in the \"more info\" tab (the same comment was widely reported elsewhere).\n \n China is trying to present its \"national determined contributions\" in the first half of next year. Among the contributions, \"the peaking year might be included,\"\n \n But I can find no relevant news since then.  There is a August 13 \"science\" discussion at http://www.nature.com/news/china-should-aim-for-a-total-cap-on-emissions-1.15705 which says\n \n First, China needs to obtain better data. Researchers must work out when Chinese emissions are likely to peak, assuming that the economy continues to grow as expected. This will provide a reliable baseline for any reduction target. It will require international scientific cooperation, because modelling for China must be informed by research results about the trajectory of emissions patterns in the EU, United States and other developed regions.  The peaking year is a complex issue and Chinese scientists and scholars differ greatly in their opinions of it.\n \n In other words, it is not easy to do at the technical level.  \n   \n (2) But in essence this issue is entirely political.  On the one hand China does not want to be tied down even to a weak non-binding target like this, without something similar from the US.  At the other extreme China could conceivably do a grand gesture in the JFK \"we will land a man on the moon within the decade\" style.  On this and many other matters,  China has to choose between engaging constructively with the international community, or following a realpolitik view of self-interest.  \n \n From a combination of general pessimism re (2) and the several \"maybes\" in (1)  I will start with a forecast of 25%.",

With midterm elections in the US coming up in November, there will be more and more pressure (both out of concern for the danger to the US that the Islamic State represents, and out of political concerns so that neither party looks \"soft on ISIS\") for the US to intervene in Syria, as they are in Iraq.

        "Right now, I don't believe there will be a vote.  If Iraq breaks apart as a country, there will be.\n \n Facts:\n - The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) approved a law for an\n    independent electoral commission.\n - The commission must be set up within 90 days of the law passing (i.e., late \n   October 2014).\n \n Assumptions:\n - The KRG can have a voting mechanism/structure/process in place to hold a \n    referendum by late December.\n - The KRG would hold a referendum without first conducting a census.\n \n Reasons for no independence vote:\n \n The KRG is pursuing a two-track policy: bargaining to stay part of Iraq on more advantageous terms while also developing the option of secession.  Holding a referendum for independence is the second choice for now, but remains a contingency plan if Iraq falls apart.\n \n - The KRG wants the following concessions:  freedom to independently sell \n   Kurdish oil; recognition of Kurdish control of Kirkuk; a guarantee from \n   Baghdad that Kurdistan resumes receiving its full share of Iraq's budget.\n  \n   - The KRG exported one million barrels of oil to Turkey in response to a \n     request from Europe.  But a U.S. court recently ruled that a tanker from  \n     Kurdistan could not unload its oil in Texas.\n   - The peshmerga took back oil production facilities in Kirkuk from ISIS.    \n     But Kirkuk is long been recognized as part of Iraqi Arab lands.\n   - Iraq currently owes the KRG $7 billion from this year's federal budget to \n     date, and the Kurds desperately need the funds.\n \n - ISIS poses a grave risk to Kurdistan's security, which it can not maintain \n   long-term without U.S. and (to a much lesser extent) Iraqi military support.\n \n - Current and future oil money from the Iraqi government in Baghdad is \n   significantly higher than any amount the KRG would get from sales solely \n   from its own territory.  Kurdistan gets 17% of Iraq's national income, \n   which was cut off in January due to KRG attempts to export its oil.  \n   Though expected to grow, Kurdistan produces less than10% of Iraq's oil \n   supply.\n \n - Kurdistan's neighbors - Iran and Turkey - have opposed independence.  \n   Both have large Kurdish minorities.  Turkey may benefit economically \n   from an independent Iraqi Kurdistan though.\n \n - International powers - the U.S. and Arab states - oppose the breakup of \n   Iraq.\n \n Sources:\n \n \"Negotiators: Kurdish Demands Supersede Ministerial Posts,\" By RUDAW, 23/8/2014 (http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/230820145)\n \n \"Iraq's future: Why the next 22 days are critical,\" By Bartle Bull, Published August 21, 2014 (http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/21/iraq-future-why-next-22-days-are-critical).\n \n \"Kurdish Independence Hangs in Limbo,\" World Policy Institute, August 19, 2014 - 9:40am (http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2014/08/19/kurdish-independence-hangs-limbo).\n \n \"Debating a Kurdish State,\" Carnegie Enowment for International Peace, Serhun Al, August 12, 2014 (http://carnegieendowment.org/sada/2014/08/12/debating-kurdish-state/hkm9).\n \n \"How far will Obama's support for the Iraqi Kurds go?\", Washington Post, By Rick Noack, August 12, 2014 (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/12/how-far-will-obamas-support-for-the-iraqi-kurds-go/)\n \n \"Kurdistan Moves Step Closer to Independence with New Election Law,\"\n By RUDAW, 24/7/2014 (http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/240720141).\n \n \"Kurdistan Isn't About to Leave Iraq Amid ISIS Fighting,\" Time, Cale Salih, Aug. 6, 2014 (http://time.com/3083172/iraq-kurdistan-independence/)",
        "Given all the reasons I cite below, I believe it extremely unlikely NATO will offer a MAP to any new country before late 2015.  There is little to gain, and much at risk, if NATO takes any sudden moves.\n \n Background.  NATO announced earlier this year that it would not offer any new countries membership in 2014.  But NATO is in various stages of considering five countries as candidates:  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Ukraine.  The first four were designated as \"aspirant countries\" at the North Atlantic Council meeting in December 2011.  However, each country faces obstacles to admission.  One problem for some is Russian opposition, which is deeply hostile to NATO advancing into former Soviet republics.  There are other problems as well (note: the following list is not exhaustive).\n  \n - Bosnia-Herzegovina has been unable to pass a key condition set by the alliance: transfer of 63 defense facilities from local authorities to the central government.\n - Georgia has not been offered a MAP out of fear of Russian retaliation.  Georgia fought a brief war with Russia in 2008, during which Georgia's rebel regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia broke away.  NATO could have been obliged to intervene in the advent of another war.  However, NATO indicated in early September 2014 that it would give Georgia 'enhanced status' as a NATO partner.\n - NATO's invitation to Macedonia was blocked by Greece in 2008.  Greece objects to the use of the name by the Republic of Macedonia because the adjacent Greek province is also called Macedonia.  NATO nations agreed that the country would receive an invitation upon resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute. \n - Montenegro was granted a MAP in 2009.  According to one source, the former Yugoslav republic of Montenegro is widely considered the candidate closest to achieving membership.  Citing the need for further reforms, Secretary-General Rasmussen said NATO would open \"intensified and focused talks, and we will assess at the latest by the end of 2015 whether to invite Montenegro to join the alliance\".\n - Ukraine's prime minister said in late August 2014 that he would ask parliament to put the country on a path towards NATO membership.  However, it is unclear if Ukrainian citizens will support such action, or what NATO's response will be to such a request.  Red-hot Russian rage to a Ukrainian application for admission is a given.\n \n Sources:\n \n \"Ukrainians Still Don't Want To Join NATO,\" Forbes, , 9/23/2014 @ 8:24AM (http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2014/09/23/ukrainians-still-dont-want-to-join-nato/)\n \n \"Hagel: U.S. Backs Georgia's New NATO Standing, Boosts Defense Support,\"\n DoD News, By Cheryl Pellerin, Sept. 7, 2014 (http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=123105)\n \n \"NATO Too Wary of Russian Threats to Let Ukraine Join,\" Time, Simon Shuster, Sept. 4, 2014 (http://time.com/3271057/nato-ukraine-membership/)\n \n \"Ukraine to seek Nato membership, says PM Yatsenyuk,\" BBC, 29 August 2014 Last updated at 06:39 ET (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28978699)\n \n \"NATO rules out admitting new members anytime soon,\" Fox News, Associated Press, Published July 05, 2014 (http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/07/05/nato-rules-out-admitting-new-members-anytime-soon/)\n \n \"NATO will not offer Georgia membership step, avoiding Russia clash,\" Reuters, By Adrian Croft, Wed Jun 25, 2014 8:35am EDT (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/25/us-nato-enlargement-idUSKBN0F00IJ20140625)\n \n \"Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to NATO,\" Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_to_NATO)\n \n Accession of Macedonia to NATO,\" Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Macedonia_to_NATO#cite_note-veto-1)\n \n \"Macedonia naming dispute,\" Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute)\n \n \"Accession of Montenegro to NATO,\" Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Montenegro_to_NATO)\n \n \"Enlargement of NATO,\" Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_NATO)",
        "Thanks to Hawksridge for starting this problem.\n \n For the present, I'm forecasting a low chance of Ebola appearing in an EU country.  This could certainly change as time progresses.  \n \n I'm listing the case against the spread first.  Then I'm doing a 'premortem', which is the opposite of a postmortem.  It's a technique where I imagine that it's June 1st, 2015, and my prediction has turned out wrong.  I'll then try to determine what potentially could have been wrong in my forecast. This will help me monitor events if Ebola becomes out of control.\n \n \n The bottom line: Most medical experts believe the chance of Ebola spreading out of West Africa is very, very low.\n  \n  \n Quote: \"'The big question is whether sick people are going to get on a plane and spread the disease.' That answer, [the doctor] has found, depends largely on two factors: How many people are infected, and the degree of travel from the outbreak area.\" Most of the infected areas are not close to an international airport.  And almost all airports in West Africa are not major air hubs that connect to other central air traffic transit points.\n \n But even if an infected person [note: incubating the disease but not ill] flies on a plane to an international destination, the odds of fellow passengers catching the virus are extremely low.  Ebola doesn't pass easily from person to person. \"'Transmission requires very close contact with bodily fluids, like blood or mucus,' [the doctor] says. 'You need prolonged contact with somebody.'\"  Several doctors point out this is exactly the opposite of other diseases, such as a virulent influenza outbreak.  \n \n There are historical cases of people with Ebola who traveled by air and did not infect anyone else on the plane.  Also, people with full-blown Ebola would be too sick to travel.\n \n \n PREMORTEM:\n \n OFFICIAL EBOLA ESTIMATES WERE TOO LOW/PROJECTED CASES GREW FASTER THAN EXPECTED; INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO HALT DISEASE BEFORE PANDEMIC\n \n The longer the epidemic goes on without effective external intervention, the likelihood that total number of cases increases, and so does the risk of international spread.  If the outbreak is not contained in time, hundreds of thousands of people could be infected in three months.\n \n \"The World Health Organization (WHO) is using an educated guess of 20,000 cases before the end, in order to plan the scale of the response.  But the true potential of the outbreak is unknown and the WHO figure has been described to me as optimistic by some scientists.\"  Conservatively, other estimates state the laboratory-confirmed case count is threefold below the actual number of people infected, which could put an estimate of today's caseload as high as 15,000 cumulative, perhaps 12,000 actively infected.\n \n \"Officially the World Health Organization is saying the outbreak can be contained in six to nine months. But that is based on getting the resources to tackle the outbreak, which are currently stretched too thinly to contain Ebola as it stands.\"  Without effective intervention now, many experts predict there could be up to 250,000 people cumulatively infected in West Africa in 90 days.\n \n \n \"Not a single reported Ebola case has made the leap from the West African outbreak to the United States or Europe - or Asia or Australia. Only two nations, Senegal and Nigeria, have seen any Ebola cases slip out of the virus's hot zone centered on Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Maintaining this lucky streak will only get more difficult - and soon impossible - as the outbreak grows exponentially.\n \n \"[One] Ebola model is run by Dirk Brockmann at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin. His team found that the probability, for example, that an infected person will board a flight from Freetown, Sierra Leone, and arrive in the United Kingdom is about 7 percent. For the United States, it's 1.5 percent. Those odds might sound high, but as Brockmann explains, they mean that 67 infected individuals would need to board a plane for one of them to reach the United States. 'This is indeed small,' Brockmann said. The problem is that the odds are getting lower. The lucky streak can not continue if the epidemic is not brought under control.\" [NOTE: COMPARISON CLASS]\n \n EBOLA COULD BE TRANSMITTED FROM AN AFRICAN HOTSPOT VIA DIRECT FLIGHTS TO EUROPE\n \n \"'The chance of Ebola spreading out of West Africa is very, very low,' says infectious disease specialist  Karman Khan, with St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. 'But if it did spread, Paris is probably the first city on the list.'\"\n \n \"The major city affected by the Ebola outbreak is Conakry, Guinea, home to about a million people and an international airport. But it's not a central hub, like Hong Kong International Airport or Chicago O'Hare.\n \n 'The volume of travel in the Conakry airport is low,' Khan says. \"Most of the flights are local. But 10 percent of the traffic goes to Paris.' That would make Paris the likeliest place for Ebola to arrive.\"\n \n CASES MULTIPLIED IN NIGERIA, AND EBOLA SPREAD TO AT LEAST 30 OTHER NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD\n \n \"At this moment, ...Ebola spillover has resulted in infection...in Nigeria (two distinct clusters of connected cases). ... If this expands, the spread of Ebola inside Nigeria, particularly in Lagos - a city with a population of approximately 22 million - would put the world's epidemic into completely uncharted territory.\"\n \n DESPITE THE LOW PROBABILITY, EBOLA MUTATED TO A MORE TRANSMITTABLE, LESS DEADLY FORM\n \n \"[One doctor's] concern is that the virus is being given its first major opportunity to adapt to thrive in people, due to the large number of human-to-human transmissions of the virus during this outbreak of unprecedented scale.\"\n \n \"Ebola virus has a high rate of mutation and with mutation comes the possibility of adapting.\n \n [The doctor] argues:  'It is increasing exponentially and the fatality rate seems to be decreasing, but why?\n \n Is it better medical care, earlier intervention or is the virus adapting to humans and becoming less pathogenic? As a virologist that's what I think is happening.'\"\n \n \"There is a relationship between how deadly a virus is and how easily it spreads. Generally speaking if a virus is less likely to kill you, then you are more likely to spread it - although smallpox was a notable exception.\n \n [The doctor] said 'it really wouldn't surprise me' if Ebola adapted, the death rate fell to around 5% and the outbreak never really ended.\"\n \n \n \"Luck has kept Ebola out of the U.S. But that's very likely to change.\", Washington Post, By Todd C.

        "In addition to my 8/28/14 post on the Forum, I've come across the following info.  While it says nothing about a possible nuke detonation, other recent nuclear activity and the possible use of U.S. prisoners for resuming nuclear negotiations could be evidence of an overall North Korean strategy.  A nuke test would fit into the pattern.  I realize this is just a initial hypothesis without strong support.

        "Based on this source:  I can't parse out whether this reunion thing is part of the pattern of a \"charm offensive\" before a provocation stage or whether it's an actual \"thawing\" of ties on north korea's part. Therefore, I'm going with \"50%\" chance of a missile launch by May 1. After all, 38 North, the North Korea watching renowned and widely quoted website and think tank, says that preparations on the missile launch site will be completed by April, which gives Kim Jong Un some time to ready a missile for launch. Here it is, from the AP:  \"A U.S. research institute says an upgrade of North Korea's main rocket launch pad could be complete by April, meaning it would be ready for new launches.\"   And from the Diplomat:  \"...As North Korea well knows, there is virtually no possibility that the U.S. and the ROK will agree to call off the exercise, which is precisely the reason it has made the demand. At most, the allies might agree to forgo some parts of the drill that the North sees as most provocative. Even then, they would only do so quietly with no formal announcement.  Pyongyang and Seoul plan to continue discussions ostensibly aimed at finding a compromise that allows for the family reunions to move forward. These are likely to be futile as North Korea almost certainly doesn&apos;t want to find common ground, but rather wants to use the Foal Eagle exercise to blame Seoul for a breakdown in relations.  It&apos;s possible that it may be content with stopping there. However, given how much effort it has put into the charm offensive in recent weeks, North Korea likely has a larger goal in mind. The best case scenario is that the charm offensive has been a ruse to woo China. Chinese-North Korean relations have continued to deteriorate in recent months, with some of the discord playing itself out in public. Beijing consistently urges all parties on the Peninsula to take measures that improve peace and stability, and North Korea may hope its charm offensive - along with blaming the breakdown on South Korea and the U.S. - will put it back in China&apos;s good graces.  The more troubling scenario is that the charm offensive has been laying the groundwork for another round of provocations. If so, there have been a number of signs that suggest that it will take the form of a missile test, likely to be followed closely by the country&apos;s fourth nuclear test. Last week Johns Hopkins University&apos;s 38 North said satellite imagery showed that upgrades to a launching pad were nearing completion, and when finished would enable the site to launch larger rockets.  Then, on Monday, ROK Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin told the National Assembly that North Korea had finished preparations for a fourth nuclear test, while adding that there were no signs that one was imminent. Still, North Korea&apos;s nuclear tests are almost always preceded by a missile test, which North Korea disingenuously portrays as part of a peaceful space program. It then uses the international community&apos;s \"hostile\" response to its space exploration to justify a nuclear test.\"",

        "First some diplomatic protocol:\n \n \"State visits are considered to be the HIGHEST expression of friendly bilateral relations between two sovereign states, and are in general characterised by an emphasis on official public ceremonies.\" (Wikipedia)\n \n THE WEST\n \n Since 2005 no head of a Western country has visited Iran. Austrian head of state was invited by Rouhani to visit on April but nothing has been heard on the subject ever since. This is the closest a Western head of state got to visit Iran. \n \n RUSSIA \n \n When it comes to Russia, a visit of Putin was supposed to occur right after Sochi:\n \n http://voiceofrussia.com/2014_01_24/US-seriously-concerned-about-Putin-s-visit-to-Iran-6520/\n \n But Ukraine has probably made Iran a lower priority for Russia. And likely made Russia a lower priority for an Iran trying to please the West too. \n \n Last GJP season we forecasted on military exercises and trade agreements between Iran and Russia which did not occur. The relationship between the two countries might be good, but the failure to implement these policies suggest that strenghtening ties for the two states to antagonize the West is not the priority.\n \n Priority for Iran is definitely the west and any unnecessary appeasement of Russia could hamper that.  \n \n Invitations have not been renewed from the side of Iran since February.\n \n Last visit of Putin in Iran was in 2007. \n \n Putin is in my opinion the most likely candidate, however we should look at his record when it comes to state visits.\n \n In February he promised to visit Japan in Autumn, it didn't happen, because Abe dismissed him fearing to displease the West considered the sanctions.\n \n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/08/us-russia-japan-idUSBREA170I620140208\n \n He did indeed visit China in May after promising to do that in March.\n \n http://thediplomat.com/2014/03/putin-to-visit-china-in-near-future/\n \n CHINA\n \n Regarding China, the last two head of states have never visited Iran and probably does not want to scare the west by doing so.\n \n If we were to divide these three blocks (West, Russia and China) to sum up to the 100% probability, we would give a 33% probability for each. \n I consider unlikely that Western leaders or China will visit Iran and I consider partially unlikely that Russia will. \n \n My initial forecast is therefore 25%\n \n State visits are usually planned and announced months in advance. I will therefore give a 2 months limit before the closing date for an announcement to be made. \n \n This gives us 156 days.\n \n I will therefore update my forecast downwards every 6 days. \n   \n \n Enabling Events\n \n I believe an enabling event would be a reached agreement regarding Iran centrifuges, this will increase international popularity of Rouhani and the possibility that head of states would want to visit Iran. I will increase my forecast of 7% when this occurs.\n \n I also believe that important enabling events are state visits of Rouhani to any of these states. He only made state visits to Kyrgyzstan and Oman so far. For G8+China countries it would be \"diplomatically safer\" for the head of state to invite Rouhani first rather than visiting Iran. However it should be considered that usually a state visit is not immediately followed by a reciprocal visit. (increase of 10%) \n \n Foreign ministers visits to Iran are also slightly enabling events (3% increase). \n \n ",

        "Comparison Classes:\n \n Kurdistan Regional Government President Barzani has threatened secession in the past. In 2007, when a referendum to decide Kirkuk feature was to be held by Iraq, he threatened secession by September (without referendum). This never actually happened.\n \n Source: http://www.iraqinews.com/baghdad-politics/barzani-threatens-to-secede-from-iraq-if-crisis-not-settled-before-september/\n \n So far I haven't found any international scenario that could be compared to the situation of Kurdistan and Iraq at the moment. \n \n Hunt for Info:\n \n Now Kurdistan has de facto control of Kirkuk and they're not going to make again the mistake of leaving it. Barzani has also proposed a referendum in Kirkuk and analysts (see Other perspectives link) say this is the one he holds most dearly while he's ready to negotiate for the other. However see also considerations on the feasability of this latter referendum in Norms & Protocols. \n \n \n Recently Kurdistan has increased its oil export capacity, which is pivotal to reach economic independence,\n \n Source: http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/19/us-iraq-security-oil-kurdistan-idUSKBN0GJ14K20140819?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews \n \n but it is still strapped for cash and lacks the infrastructure to increase exports substantially. \n Source: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28103124?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter\n \n Adjust:\n \n I see as an enabling scenario the increasing insecurity and the inability of the new Iraq prime minister to create a government of unity. If this happens within one month I will increase the possibility for the referendum to be held by 30%.\n \n \n Select Effort: I will weekly look for new information regarding the referendum.\n \n Know Players:\n \n Turkey has strong economic ties with Kurdistan and is its main economic partner. Turkey is gradually changing its view regarding Kurdish independence, looking to see what will happen in Iraq in the next months before declaring its support to independence. In any case it is going to be pivotal in the quest for independence. \n \n Turkey is an ally of the US, which are contrary to Kurdistan independence. \n \n The risk of becoming too dependent on Turkey however, might push the leadership to look for other allies, at the moment absent. \n \n The third party (PUK) is strenghtening its ties with Iran, which is concerned regarding Kurdistan independence and an ally of Russia, generally contrary to independence of small territories from states.\n \n \n IRAQ: In this moment of crisis and political transition they need unity and military support from Kurdistan. Therefore Kurdistan knows they are in a good negotiating situation to have gains, especially when it comes to the permission to export oil to Turkey (which was the source of conflict early this year) and buying more time to prepare for a future independence.\n \n The call for a referendum seems to be just a way to put pressure on Baghdad as Barzani has done earlier. \n \n However al-Abadi, the new prime minister of Iraq comes from the same Dawa party as al-Maliki and just on January cut Iraqi Kurdistan from the national budget when the Kurds refused to let Baghdad monopolize oil production and exports even though the Kurds promised to share the revenue with the rest of Iraq.\n \n \n Source:http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/21082014\n \n The 18% share of profits that Baghdad was giving to Kurdistan is much more remunerative than the control of Kirkuk.\n \n al-Abadi has a bad record regarding his attitude towards Kurds and he is likely (70%) to fail in the hard task of creating a true government of unity. Considering the IS menace, he might focus on allying with the Sunnis and ignoring the requests of the Kurds.\n \n \n Barzani: These kind of threats are his trademark even though they never take place. An anonymous source stated that Barzani was not as clear regarding the referendum as the media outlets described.\n Source: http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/iraq-kurdistan-barzani-puk-division-independence-iran-turkey.html\n \n Kurdistan Government: There is not political unity among the different parties regarding the usefulness of the referendum at this moment of time. Gorran and some members of PUK are opposing it. \n \n While Kurds negotiators might be posturing at Baghdad, Kurdistan is aware of his economic vulnerability.\n \n Norms and protocols\n \n Despite calls of Barzani for the referendum to be held within 2014, experts say the process of creating a commission might take months.\n Kurds are in fact preparing the legal framework in the Kurdistan regional parliament for a referendum on self-determination.\n \n There is still nothing on the parliament website regarding the referendum. I found nothing on the constitution regarding the time or the procedures for organizing a referendum.\n \n However on 24 July the Kurdistan Regional Government passed a law that allows the commission to hold elections, referendums and fix dates for voting without having to refer to Baghdad.\n \n The law makes reference to \"Kurdistan,\" not the Kurdistan Region, making it applicable in all territories controlled by the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government since June, when the KRG moved forces into areas it considers its own, and that were abandoned by Iraqi forces retreating under a jihadi-led advance.\n \n Source:http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/240720141\n \n Holding the referendum in Kirkuk area will however be considered illegal following the Article 140 of the Iraqi constitution. KRG will hardly find any international support if they try to annex an area they have been controlling for one month without the consent of Baghdad (which is unlikely to give up a rich territory so easily). \n \n Source: http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/11072014\n \n Kirkuk council has a majority of PUK members who might linger in giving their support to the referendum, considering their political stance (see above). \n \n I believe that the commission will consider an appropriate time for the organisation of the referendum and campaigning. This is why 3 months seem a time too short. \n \n Other perspectives\n \n An energy advisor of the KRG just at the beginning of this year stated that it will take five more years before Kurdistan can \"afford\" independence\n Source: http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/25012014\n \n Here is a detailed analysis on why independence is still not feasible for Kurdistan: http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/the-kurdish-move-towards-independence   \n \n Wildcards:\n \n If al-Abadi attempt to create a government of unity will fail completely and Kurds will not accept his attempts to find a compromise, Kurdistan might speed the process for the referendum. \n \n A negotiator gave three months to solve the issue of the disputed territories, this would leave very little time to actually hold a referendum. \n \n http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/df5896e0-27bb-11e4-ae44-00144feabdc0.html \n ",

        "This event is unlikely to happen before 1 JAN, 2014 for the following reasons:  1) The current position of the US is that NK must demonstrate substantial commitment towards denuclearization before it will participate in six-party talks.  Given that we have held that position since shortly after the talks collapsed in 2008, it is unlikely to change in the next few months.  This condition frames the question around whether or not NK is willing to climb down from their 'never give up nukes' position.  That change is possible under heavy carrot-and-stick from China, but they would have to be very big carrots and sticks.    http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/797612.shtml  2) The US and South Korea recently concluded talks directed at maintaining the sanctions regime on NK.

China also had talks this week with Japan in an effort to get Tokyo to ease up on some of its preconditions for talks to resume.  Clearly, the PRC is trying to shake up the moribund talks and demonstrate that it is a regional player who can get things done and thus should be taken seriously on the geopolitical stage.  China expects to be rewarded for its efforts, describing them as 'gifts'.  These efforts do have a chance of bearing fruit if the White House can be convinced that China can deliver movement from North Korea towards what they characterize as a peninsula-wide denuclearization goal.  But as much as the Obama Administration would like to have a new feather in its rather threadbare foreign policy cap, it's backed itself into too deep of a 'get tough on North Korea' corner over the last few years to see the talks start before the end of the year short of a truly astonishing success by Beijing at getting NK to agree to end its nuke programs.    http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/26/us-korea-north-china-idUSBRE96P0A920130726    http://japandailypress.com/japan-china-hold-talks-over-north-korea-issues-0533352 ",

U.S. officials confirmed the Iranian claim that the Sejil-2 had a 2,000 to 2,500 km range, and a May 2009 joint threat assessment by American and Russian technical experts estimated that Sejil-2 had the capability of carrying a one ton warhead 2,200 km.   Solid propellant missiles do not have to be fueled immediately prior to launch, making them easier to store in near-ready condition in hidden, hardened locations. They can be moved around and fired on short notice, including from mobile launchers. All of this makes them harder to find and target and less vulnerable during launch.  Given Iran&acirc;\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds track record in this area it is reasonable to assume that four years after the first announced launch of the Sejil-2 it has either extended its range beyond 2,500 km or developed a new solid-fuel ballistic missile capable of exceeding 2,500 km. There is an unconfirmed report that a three-stage Sejil 3 ballistic missile is in development that will have a range of 4,000 km.   While from an Iranian point of view test-launching a longer range ballistic missile may be desirable for validation purposes, from an international perspective, a test-launch would add to a list of reasons that could be used to justify an airstrike on Iran that might include targets that would degrade its missile production and launch infrastructure.   The Sejil-2 is already capable of hitting targets in Israel, Turkey, India, and U.S. military bases in the Middle East. A ballistic missile with a range of 4,000 km would be capable of hitting targets in Egypt, Libya, Eastern Europe, and Italy. Conducting what is sure to be viewed as a provocative test-launch of a ballistic missile capable of striking these additional targets would not seem worth the risk given the international pressure that Iran already faces regarding its nuclear and missile programs.  In 2006, the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1737, which banned the supply of materials and technology to Iran that might aid nuclear activities or the development of ballistic missile programs and nuclear weapon delivery systems. Three subsequent U.N. Security Council resolutions, 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008), and 1929 (2010) increased sanctions. Sanctions adopted by the European Union and the United States have gone even farther.   If, however, Iran had a grander short-term goal, the risk of a launch before May 2014 might be justified from its perspective. Iranian ballistic missiles with a 2,500 to 4,000 km range carrying high-explosive warheads have little deterrent value. Ballistic missiles in that range carrying nuclear warheads could be used to provide a deterrent umbrella that in addition to Iran, might also cover Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Oman, and Bahrain, for instance, which could significantly alter the balance of power in the Middle East and trigger a race by other Middle Easter countries to acquire their own nuclear weapons capability.  If Iran has produced or acquired nuclear weapons by late Spring of 2014, it may decide to test-launch a ballistic missile with a range that exceeds 2,500 km before May 1, 2014 and gamble that these nuclear weapons will survive an airstrike even if their nuclear weapons production infrastructure is degraded by the airstrike.  Iran might also gain enough confidence via computer simulations to construct and hide versions of the extended-range ballistic missile it test-fires prior to May 1, 2014 and gamble that if the test-launch validates their computer simulations, even if an airstrike occurs and degrades their missile production and launch infrastructure, they could very quickly assemble extended range ballistic missiles carrying nuclear payloads.  Years ago Iran opted to play a very dangerous game. A best-case outcome of this game from their point of view would be for the world to accept Iran as a nuclear weapons power and rely on deterrence to contain them. A realistic worse-case scenario from their perspective would be a devastating air attack that would set their nuclear and missile programs back five years or more. An acceptable outcome for Iran might be one that would allow Iran to leverage a limited ability to launch nuclear strikes following an airstrike on Iran to deter future attacks while it rebuilds.   If Iran HAS been subjected to an airstrike by a foreign or multinational military force prior to May 2014, in my view the odds that it will test-launch an extended-range ballistic missile before May 2014, are considerably less than even.   If Iran HAS NOT been subjected to an airstrike by a foreign or multinational military force prior to May 2014, in my view the odds that it will test-launch an extended-range ballistic missile before May 2014, are considerably better than even.

        "This question is fraught with peril, yet all of the major risks and players are known. If Netanyahu truly feels that a nuclear-armed Iran would be a clear and present danger to the very existence of Israel, than as he has stated* he would have a solemn obligation to do everything in his power to prevent that from occurring for as long as possible - including making his case directly to Congress - which has already been weighing tougher sanctions against Iran.

        "According to the Reuters article \"countries like the United States and Pakistan have complained that the program distorts trade.\" One of their concerns is that India is accumulating so much grain - with millions of tons rotting for lack of storage space - that the country will inevitably end up dumping some of it onto the world market, which would depress global prices and hurt farmers in other countries.\n \n This appears to be either a case of misguided, heavy-handed U.S. trade negotiating tactics (trying to force India to back down to benefit farmers in other countries that have a fraction of India's 1.2 billion people to feed), or an effort to deliberately scuttle the WTO Trade Agreement in a somewhat subtler fashion than the U.S. Senate stalled the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) during GJP Season 3.\n \n If the problem is concern about India flooding the market with millions of tons of \"rotting\" grain (what is the market for rotting grain these days anyway?) excluding India from the TFA protocol (the \"deal without India\" route won't solve the surplus grain problem, and in any event is certainly not the best way to solve that dilemma. Why not encourage India to convert the surplus grain into ethanol and sell it to China, for example? India could finance its subsidy outlays to its poor farmers with the revenue created from selling fuel that China needs, and in the process, create a lot of jobs. \n \n My initial forecast here presumes that if the WTO food subsidy rules are approved, India would sign off, making the vote unanimous, which would lead to approval before 1-1-15.

        "Daily Forecast\n News Sourcing\n \n ***\n \n One of the more amusing things (or perhaps mystifying if your tastes run that way) about the Greek dust up and election has been the way in which the European left has been shouting that it's all about democracy. If the Greeks aren't allowed to run their economy their way then this will be a denial of that most basic of political rights. So Germany should just open the wallet and get on paying for things. This isn't, of course, how democracy actually works: the demos of Germany has to be included in this decision about what Greece gets to do with German money. The demos of Greece has every right to decide what they want to do with their own money. But not with that of others of course.\n \n And it's that German demos which means that Germany, or at least its politicians, simply cannot give in and give Greece what is being demanded. Simply because the Germans themselves, the people who go out and earn the money that becomes the taxes that Greece is insisting should pay its debts, don't want that to happen. As this interesting little article says:\n \n Berlin cabdriver Jens Mueller says he's had it with the Greek government and he doesn't want Germany to send any more of his tax money to be squandered in Athens.\n \n \"They've got a lot of hubris and arrogance, being in the situation they're in and making all these demands,\" said Mueller, 49, waiting for fares near the Brandenburg Gate. \"Maybe it's better for Greece to just leave the euro.\"\n \n Mueller's sentiment is shared by a majority of Germans. A poll published March 13 by public broadcaster ZDF found 52 percent of his countrymen no longer want Greece to remain in Europe's common currency, up from 41 percent last month. The shift is due to a view held by 80 percent of Germans that Greece's government \"isn't behaving seriously toward its European partners.\"\n \n Well, OK, cab drivers are actually on oath to provide good quotes for visiting reporters*. But that public opinion there really is something that German politicians need to take account of (as in any good democracy they should, in fact in any good democracy they should be positively petrified of the opinions of the electors). And if the German taxpayers and voters are not just not willing to pay for Greece's debts but are actively supporting the idea that Greece should leave the euro then there's really very little indeed that can be done in the negotiations.\n \n \n There is, of course, always the time tested political expedient of simply lying to the people but this has already been done to about the extent that it can be. There's one real number that is sticking in the minds of that German electorate: the total amount of the Greek debt. Not that everyone could immediately tell you what the number is but the news that it was being reduced would pretty quickly get around and cause ructions. Those ructions almost certainly including the unelection of whichever politicians had agreed to it. Thus we've had (lying is too strong a word as yet, given how commonplace this sort of thing is in politic) the, umm, imprecision about certain portions of the deal that Greece has been offered. For extending the maturity of the loans and reducing the interest rates on them has exactly the same economic effect as reducing the principal of the loans. We're just substituting inflation as the mechanism of the write down for the express political acknowledgement of it. But this has been taken as far as it can be. The German electorate simply isn't going to accept any more reductions in what must be repaid to the German taxpayer.\n \n Which brings us back to that point from the leftists about democracy. Yep, OK, so democracy should win. But whose democracy? That of the Greeks who have already spent the money? Or of the Germans who might end up having to pay for it?\n \n ****\n \n Senior German politicians have broken ranks with Angela Merkel's government to demand that Germany pay reparations to Greece for Nazi crimes committed during the Second World War.\n \n The move by key figures from two parties that are Ms Merkel's junior coalition partners broke a 25-year taboo on a subject that Berlin has consistently maintained is \"closed\"  - and followed repeated demands by the new Greek government for war compensation payments to help offset its deepening national debt.\n \n \"In my view the issue is absolutely clear, we should provide financial help for the victims and their relatives,\" said Gesine Schwan, 71, a senior Social Democrat who ran twice for the office of German president. \"It is a matter of recognising that we committed terrible crimes in Greece.\"\n \n Her view was echoed by the deputy Social Democrat leader, Ralf Stegner. \"I believe we should be leading the discussion about reparations,\" he told Der Spiegel, though he added: \"We should not link the issue with the current debate about the euro crisis.\"\n \n April 1941: Men who stayed to defend the Greek city of Salonika are finally captured by the overwhelming Nazi presence (Keystone/Getty Images) The Greens' parliamentary party leader, Anton Hofreiter, said: \"Germany cannot just sweep Greece's demand off the table. This chapter is not closed, neither from a moral nor legal standpoint.\" He said Ms Merkel's government would be \"well advised to seek a solution\".\n \n The proposal - likely to be met with a frosty response by German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble - appeared to open the door to compensation claims from other countries occupied by the Nazis, including more than 20 current members of the European Union, if accepted. Conservative politicians in Poland previously made similar demands which went unanswered.\n \n Nazi Germany murdered thousands of Greek citizens during its occupation of the country from 1941 to 1944. Adolf Hitler's regime also forced the Greek national bank to supply Germany with credits worth the equivalent of between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac8bn and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac11bn (\u00c2\u00a35.75bn to \u00c2\u00a38bn) at current value, and never repaid the sum. Since its election, the new Greek government led by Alexis Tsipras has reopened the issue of German war reparations, arguing that compensation from Berlin could be used to ward off the prospects of Greek bankruptcy. Last week the Greek justice minister threatened moves to confiscate German property if the issue is not resolved.\n \n \n ****\n BRUSSELS-Technical talks between Greece and its creditors aren't going well, officials said Wednesday, with each blaming the other for the snags in crucial negotiations.\n \n Teams from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund are getting very little information on the government's finances and other key topics in Athens, two European officials said.\n \n \"The line was that the Greeks aren't cooperating,\" said one of the officials, summarizing the institutions' account during a teleconference among senior eurozone finance ministry officials on Tuesday.\n \n A Greek official said the technical teams had gone beyond their role as fact-finders and had sought to intervene in politics, continuing a frequent line of complaint from Athens about the so-called troika of inspectors.\n \n The technical work is key to figuring out when Greece may run out of money and whether the rest of the eurozone is prepared to provide further support to the left-wing government.\n \n Eurozone finance ministers agreed last month to extend Greece's \u00e2\u0082\u00ac240 billion ($254 billion) bailout by four months until the end of June. However, there has been little progress on defining reform measures in return for sustained aid, raising concerns over Greece's future in the eurozone.\n \n During the teleconference, the Greek representative said his government wasn't prepared to talk about the country's finances with technical experts and instead wanted European Union leaders to discuss the issue at a summit in Brussels, one of the European officials said.\n \n \"There was a general feeling that the Greek side is completely out of touch with reality,\" said the official.\n \n 'This is the first bill in five years that doesn't take something from the people, but will offer them something.'\n -Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told lawmakers on Wednesday, referring to a new bill that would give free electricity and food stamps to low-income households. Representatives of the three institutions said that, based on the limited information they have, the Greek government will be able to sustain payments only for another few weeks, according to the official. They also asked the Greek government to hold off on moving ahead with bill that would provide new support for the poor, until they've had time to assess its impact on the budget, in line with the agreement on extending the bailout.\n \n The Parliament in Athens is due to vote later Wednesday on the bill, which would give free electricity and food stamps to low-income households in an effort to offset the impact of Greece's protracted austerity program. Those measures are expected to cost around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac200 million and the government says they will be offset by other cutbacks that include reducing spending at ministries and adopting a new, more transparent system for awarding state procurement contracts.\n \n \"This is the first bill in five years that doesn't take something from the people but will offer them something,\" Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told lawmakers.\n \n Mr. Tsipras also said Greece plans to push ahead with a parliamentary vote later this week to reopen the state broadcaster and offer taxpayers more lenient terms on arrears owed, without having been given the green light from international creditors.\n \n The location and content of talks has been a sticking point over the last two months. Greece had pushed for the talks to be held in Brussels, saying the troika's previous forays in the Greek capital have been disruptive and sparked protests.\n \n But European officials insisted that some experts would need to be in Greece to access key data on government accounts, for instance, and to speak to experts at ministries.\n \n In the hope of finding a political solution, Mr. Tsipras has asked to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on the sidelines of an EU summit later this week.\n \n If confirmed, the meeting would happen on Thursday or Friday on the margins of the summit.\n \n Greece faces yet another deadline Friday, as it has to repay some \u00e2\u0082\u00ac350 million to the International Monetary Fund and refinance some \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.6 billion of short-term notes.",

The co-ruling Pasok party would get 5.1 percent.\n \n About 15 percent of those polled said they were undecided.\n \n  \n A survey by the same pollster in October had shown Syriza leading with 6.5 percentage points over New Democracy.\n \n The ruling coalition last week brought a key presidential vote forward by two months, leaving a final bailout review and plans for a negotiated exit from its EU/IMF bailout program up in the air, while it seeks parliamentary backing.\n \n To survive the vote, the government needs the backing of 180 lawmakers. Failure to get its nominee for the largely ceremonial post elected by the final round of voting on Dec. 29 would trigger a snap parliamentary election.\n \n About 64 percent of those polled by GPO last week approved of the government's decision to bring the presidential vote forward. More than half of the respondents said they wanted the current parliament to elect a president, while 59 percent said the risk of a euro zone exit had not been removed.\n \n Tsipras ranked first in popularity among political leaders, but Samaras was more suitable for prime minister, the poll showed.\n \n The GPO poll was the latest in a series of surveys that showed the gap between Syriza and New Democracy narrowing after the government brought the presidential vote forward.\n \n A separate survey by MRB for Mega TV, which was conducted Dec. 10-13, showed Syriza leading with 3.2 percentage points.\n \n An Alco poll published on Sunday showed Syriza's lead narrowing to 3.6 percentage points, from 4.8 percent earlier this month.\n \n ****",
        "Daily Forecast\n News Sourcing\n \n \n **\n \n President Petro Poroshenko has endorsed a referendum on the federalisation of Ukraine, jumpstarting the reforms foreseen by the peace plan to end the conflict with Russia-backed rebels in the country's east.\n \n \"I'm ready to hold a referendum about the structure of the government, if you think it's necessary,\" Poroshenko told a commission which will oversee constitutional reform at its first session on Monday.\n \n Federalisation was one of the key demands made by pro-Russia rebels at the start of the conflict last April as it would give largely Russian-speaking Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine a great degree of autonomy from the central government. But analysts and politicians in Kiev argue such a move would weaken the country and allow Moscow undue influence in its politics.\n \n Poroshenko left no doubt where he stood on the issue, calling federalisation an \"infection\" that he hinted was being forced on the country by foreign powers, apparently referring to Russia.\n \n \"When Ukraine united, they came at us with aggression, with war, trying to establish federalisation with iron and blood. I won't let that happen; the Ukrainian people won't let that happen,\" he told the commission.\n \n Poroshenko has said 90% of Ukrainians supported a unitary government.\n \n The adoption of a new constitution by the end of 2015 is one of the stipulations of the Minsk peace plan brokered in February by the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine. Decentralisation will be a key part of constitutional reform, but it remains unclear what form it will take.\n \n Volodymyr Groysman, chairman of the constitutional reform commission, said planning for decentralisation would begin at the next meeting on 15 April, which would also discuss human rights and judicial reforms.\n \n Advertisement\n \n Vadim Karasyov, a political analyst from Kiev, said that, the idea of federalisation was unpopular and a referendum was likely to fail. Nonetheless, the constitutional reform process would meet France and Germany's demands that Ukraine give greater autonomy to eastern regions, he said.\n \n \"I think we will be talking about the decentralisation of Ukraine within a unitary government, and Donbass will be able to hope only for special status allowing local self-government according to Ukrainian law,\" he said, referring to a historical name for Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n \n Poroshenko also said on Monday that Ukrainian would remain the only official state language, arguing that three-quarters of the population supported this. Greater official recognition of the Russian language has been a rebel demand. Last spring, Ukraine's parliament attempted to repeal a law that recognises Russian as a second official language in regions with significant Russian-speaking populations, but the acting president refused to sign the repeal.\n \n Meanwhile, Ukraine's defence ministry announced that ultranationalist MP Dmytro Yarosh was to become an aide to military chief Viktor Muzhenko and that his Right Sector fighting group would be integrated into the armed forces.\n \n The news was widely reported in Russia, where Yarosh has been criticised for his radical stances and anti-Russian statements. In February, Yarosh said in a post on Facebook that his forces would continue to fight the enemy despite the ceasefire agreed in Minsk as part of the peace plan. Rebels in eastern Ukraine have accused Right Sector of atrocities against Russian speakers.\n \n Karasyov called the appointment honorary and said it was part of an ongoing campaign to put an end to the \"private armies\" that had sprung up over the past year to help the ill-prepared Ukrainian military put down the separatist conflict. Last month, Ihor Kolomoisky, who bankrolled pro-Kiev volunteer battalions in eastern Ukraine, was removed from his post of governor of Dnipropetrovsk.\n \n \"Ukraine doesn't need scandals and it doesn't really need Yarosh,\" Karasyov said. \"This is an honourable capitulation for him and his big military goals. He will remain an MP and an aide but he won't significantly affect the policy of the defence department.\"\n \n Anton Geraschenko, an advisor in the interior ministry, said Yarosh could keep working on military initiatives. \"I see that he's bored in the [parliament], plus he's now been seriously wounded in battle, and I would love to create a volunteer defence union of Ukraine with Dmytro Yarosh like in the Estonian, Finnish and Swiss systems,\" he said.",

As a consequence, the Kurds are hated by the Turks, the Afghanis, the Syrians, the Iraqis, and the Iranians, all of whom would love nothing better than to see them exterminated.  The Turks have tried for decades to beat up on them, as have the Iranians and the Syrians.  The only break they've ever gotten was from the United States in the person of George Herbert Walker bush, when he instituted the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq.

My personal views based on reading articles in the Brazil meda, I offer below. If you read the New York Times coverage of the Eduardo Campos plane crash by Simon Romero, you will see how it gives the feel that Brazil and the United States are distant neighors. It can offer one a reminder that U.S. media coverage of Brazil and all of \"Latin\" America does have a hegemonic dimension. \n \n Official Brazil likes to showcase Marina as the poor girl from the Amazon who was found a future holding the clipboard for rubber tappers union activist Chico Mendez when Chico was on the way out and Lula was on the way in.\n \n Had Campos not crashed and burned in the Cessna jet she would still be a vice presidential candidate brought on as a \"token\" by the suave, elite Campos, who comes from a prominent white northern Brazilian family and at age 49 was doing a trial run and looking to make a serious run for the presidency in the future. The ticket, PSB (Brazilian Socialist Party) Campos, and Marina was running around 8 to 10 percent by Brazil's leading polling organization, DATAFOLHA, which is connected to the major daily newspaper and web paper Folha de Sao Paulo. \n \n Marina tried to front her own party \"The Sustainablility Network\" which was really a cover for her effiliation and political agenda with the American-advised Brazilan Assemblies of God churches. When she didn't make the cut to get on the ballot she was just hanging out there, a political orphan, and class act Campos and his team brought her on board to keep her in the game and use her image to help his candidacy.\n \n Had Campos lived, the 8-10 percent of the votes DATAFOLHA says he conrolled with Marina as his running mate would have been horsetraded to the highest bidder in the second round. Marina is a snake in the grass.\n \n These are my personal views. I suggest you draw your own conclusions with your own processes.",

Turkey also provided some assistance for the Kurds to export Kurdish oil out of the region. While the main Bagdad government still opposes an independent Kurdish state, this may prove to be an opportune time for a referendum, as long as some economic cooperation can remain in the future.\n \n The other wildcard factor is US support for the Kurds, and the growing presence of US military resources in the region to combat ISIS. The US will be more likely to support an organized Kurdish Republic, than a disorderly Iraqi government. US support, alongside Turkey, will be a factor in a Kurdish referendum.\n \n The uncertainty on the deadline is due to the evolving nature of the conflict with ISIS.

        "I was waiting for this question, or one similar. The news first thing this morning does not seem to point so much to the release of bailout funds as it does to the release of Greece from the EU. \n \n The Wall Street Journal reports:\n \n http://www.wsj.com/articles/technical-talks-on-greeces-bailout-not-going-well-officials-say-1426672526\n \n This article does not paint a pretty picture for Greece.  They are upset about the inspectors and the grim specter of austerity. What they need to do (a la Ireland) is complain about the inspectors, suck it up, adopt austerity and just get on with it. It does not appear that they are ready to do this. Certain actions have telegraphed their lack of respect for the process and their unwillingness to step into line with the rest of Europe.\n \n \"\"The line was that the Greeks aren't cooperating,\" one of the officials said, summarizing the institutions' account during a teleconference the day before among senior eurozone finance ministry officials.\n \n A Greek official said the technical teams had gone beyond their role as fact-finders and had sought to intervene in politics, continuing a frequent line of complaint from Athens about the so-called troika of inspectors.\"\n \"I continue to be worried,\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Wednesday about the talks. \"I'm not happy with the progress that's been achieved over the last few days.\" \"\n \n \"Representatives of the three institutions said that, based on the limited information they have, the Greek government would be able to sustain payments only for another few weeks, according to the one official.\n \n They also asked Greece to hold off on a bill that would provide new support for the poor until they have had time to assess its impact on the budget, in line with a deal to extend the bailout.\n \n But early Thursday, lawmakers in Athens passed the bill, the new government's first. The measures, which provide subsidized electricity and food stamps to low-income households, are expected to cost around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac200 million ($213 million).\"\n \n The New York Times takes it one step further:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/business/international/warnings-raised-of-a-greek-exit-from-the-euro.html?_r=0\n \n Warnings Raised of a Greek Exit From the Euro\n \n \"Just a few weeks ago, fears that Greece might exit the euro union subsided when Europe extended its financial bailout. But as a new war of words escalates between Athens and its creditors, talk of a \"Grexit\" is heating up.\n \n In the last several days, European and American banks, think tanks and ratings agencies have issued a fresh round of warnings and studies calculating the damage to the currency union if Greece were to default on its debts or stop using the euro.\"\n \n \"One of the main sticking points is Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's pushing ahead with an anti-austerity agenda that creditors say conflicts with pledges he made on Feb. 20 in winning an agreement to let Greece extend its 240 billion euro, or $254 billion, bailout program for four months. That deal was crucial to giving Greece the ability to unlock loan money it badly needs. But so far, no funds have been forthcoming.\n \n On Wednesday, Greece's Parliament approved a number of anti-poverty measures despite warnings from creditors that the legislation ran contrary to the overall package of changes Greece had agreed last month to adopt.\n \n And it probably did not help Greece's debt diplomacy that members of Mr. Tsipras's Syriza party were among the thousands of European demonstrators in Frankfurt on Wednesday protesting, amid tear gas, European Central Bank policies.\"\n \n None of this seems to be the way forward in the recovery process. Many of the points in Syriza's 40 point (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-01-29/syrizas-original-40-point-manifesto) plan seem to be coming to the forefront, many of these which were not main talking points during the election for the reason that they are ...well...bat-shit crazy. What Greece need to do now is let the inspectors crawl deep inside their system and suggest reforms that WILL be implemented. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the chosen path of the Greek government.\n \n \"He has persuaded Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany; President Francois Hollande of France; the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi; and others to discuss the Greek crisis directly with him. Whether he will clinch a deal to unlock funds and prevent a wider crisis remains to be seen.\"\n \n Europe will only be willing to throw money at an increasing crisis for so long, then it will be time to cut the cord...I think this will be sooner rather than later based on recent developments.\n \n The Guardian is offering live updates of the meetings at:\n \n http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/mar/19/eu-leaders-summit-greek-bailout-talks-live-updates\n \n 12:20\n European Council president Donald Tusk has played down the importance of tonight's talks, saying that it's not the last opportunity to resolve the Greek crisis.\n \n EU'S TUSK SAYS: THURSDAY MEETING WITH TSIPRAS IS NOT LAST CHANCE FOR GREECE\n EU'S TUSK SAYS: NOBODY WANTS A GREXIT OR A GREXIDENT\n EU'S TUSK SAYS: INFORMAL MEETING WILL NOT BE A DECISIVE MEETING, WILL NOT TAKE DECISIONS\n \n The above update seems to downplay the potential impacts of the meetings, but they will set the stage for subsequent actions.\n \n The more I read about this the more it seems like Greece is going to try to renegotiate the conditions of their bailout every chance they get.\n \n If Greece turns up at the summit today and promises to adhere to all conditions of their agreed bailout, then there may be funds released.  The problem with this is that they will not be telling the truth.  The conditions of the bailout run contrary to Syriza's manifesto.

        "Here's an interesting blurb from FT.com blog. The writer used to work for the IMF. \n \n For a prediction, I don't think the IMF, headquartered in Washington DC, will add this currency. Mostly because of inertia.  The US have 16% of the total votes and Japan is number two on the list. If China gets a seat it lessens the influence of the others. The US exercises an outsized control on this organization. It would have to happen with their approval. There is a decent chance (it's not impossible). But there's also a chance that the review (which was supposed to be done by end of 2014) happens after the June date. There's also a chance that China decides to bypass the IMF and not play their game. Interesting question... \n \n \n ***\n \n \n The IMF - with its central role in the international monetary system - is a particularly key player. If the renminbi were to be included in the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDR) reserve asset (effectively a basket of reserve currencies), which is up for review next year, it would be a significant step up for renminbi internationalisation.\n \n Effectively, inclusion in the SDR would serve as an official acknowledgement of the renminbi reserve-currency status, and central banks of all IMF member countries would automatically gain renminbi exposure through their SDR holdings. It would encourage new central banks to enter the renminbi market, and those already there to increase their allocations.\n \n However, even without taking this step, the IMF could play a key role by setting out how renminbi investments can be reported 'officially' to ensure that smaller central banks and those on IMF programmes - for whom current reporting rules could be an issue - are not put off from investing in renminbi. In its approach to the renminbi, the IMF should let itself be guided by facts and technical analysis of renminbi usage, not by politics.\n \n http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/08/20/guest-post-french-swiss-central-banks-swell-rush-to-hold-renminbi/?",

The army also supports Sharifs attempt to minimize expensive energy dependency, and to increase GNP to allow the country to pay civilian and military expenses.\n    Protests against Sharif have been minimized by the army, indicating that the motivation for a coup may not be as strong.

        "The Kurds may eventually have a referendum, but it may be too soon.\n When the mid East was split into countries after WWI, national borders were drawn that cut across ethnic and religious lines.  The hope was that the nations would be secular with various groups co-existing within each nation.  The current issues in the mid-east reflect a breakdown of that secular nation state concept.  Iraq is an excellent example, as the US and others attempt to hold tthe country together while the Shia, Sunni, and Kurd groups seem to prefer to go it alone.  A mid-east re-imagined in religious/ethnic blocks, may be occur at some future date, but, the main players seem to be against that at the moment.\n     As the Kurds are themselves divided, and dependent on The US and Turkey, It seems they will need to wait for a better opportunity. Currently the Iraqi constitution limits the Kurds ability to directly export oil, so they also remain tied to Iraq.\n     Surely, if a referendum were held, it would pass almost unanimously, but as long as the power players that the Kurds depend on wish to keep Iraq from splintering, I don't believe it will happen.

Their leaders must know that provoking Saudi Arabia may mean a swift end to their so far brief reign in much of Yemen.\n \n Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, has traditionally avoided large scale military confrontations with its neighbours and is currently in a transitional phase, so is unlikely to launch an assault on Yemen. \n \n  Of course, when military conflict is involved, there is always a much higher risk of unintended events occurring, so I will rank this as high as 20%, even though I believe that there is only a 10% chance that either side would seek to deliberately provoke such a conflict.",

        "The following article provides a backdrop for OPEC's current oil politics:\n \n ttp://seekingalpha.com/article/2561845-energy-xxi-high-cost-high-leverage-weak-energy-prices-good-short?source=email_rt_article_readmore&uprof=45&dr=1\n \n Key quotes:\n \n \"Saudi Arabia is quietly telling oil market participants that Riyadh is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices for an extended period, a sharp shift in policy that may be aimed at slowing the expansion of rival producers including those in the U.S. shale patch.\n \n Some OPEC members including Venezuela are clamoring for urgent production cuts to push global oil prices back up above $100 a barrel. But Saudi officials have telegraphed a different message in private meetings with oil market investors and analysts recently: the kingdom, OPEC's largest producer, is ready to accept oil prices below $90 per barrel, and perhaps down to $80, for as long as a year or two, according to people who have been briefed on the recent conversations.\" (Emphasis added.)\n \n Another article stated:\n \n \"On Sunday, Ali al-Omair, oil minister of Saudi Arabia's core Gulf ally Kuwait, appeared to be the first to articulate the emerging view of OPEC's most influential member, saying output cuts would do little to prop up prices in the face of rising production from Russia and the United States.\n \n 'I don't think today there is a chance that (OPEC) countries would reduce their production,' state news agency KUNA quoted him as saying.\n \n Omair said that prices should stop falling at around $76 to $77 a barrel, citing production costs in places such as the United States, where a shale oil boom has unexpectedly reversed dwindling output and pushed production to its highest level since the 1980s.\"\n \n There are several factors at play here:\n \n 1.  The projected demand for oil has dropped considerably (22%) as noted in http://online.wsj.com/articles/iea-cuts-its-2014-oil-demand-growth-forecast-to-its-weakest-in-five-years-1413274259.  A slowdown in China and Europe are reducing demand.\n \n 2.  The supply of oil is far in excess of demand in great part due to the tremendous growth of oil production in the U.S. market via fracking.  At the present time U.S. oil production is exceeding the ability to use or store oil.\n \n 3.  The effect of sanctions on Russia have signficantly degraded its economy and Russia has become dependent on oil revenue to sustain itself.  Maintaining sales is leading to a price war to ensure Russian oil is fully purchased in the open market.\n \n 4.  OPEC nations have the staying power to manage a sustained reduction in the oil price to shake out \"weaker\" players in the market.  If oil continues to drop, it may create revenue shortfall in OPEC but those producers who have higher production costs (which may include U.S. frackers\" may be forced to curtail their expansion.  This, in fact, may be a strategy employed by OPEC to dissuade growth in U.S. oil production.\n \n 5.  The Saudis, Kuwaitis and Iranis all have pledged to stay the course without production cuts.  Iran's economy has suffered for years due to sanctions incluing those on oil.  It is unlikely that they would have interest in reducing production with the hope of increasing the price.  Until and unless there was an enforceable agreement among all OPEC nations to reduce production (historically even after pledging to do so most member nations did not abide by pledges) there would seem to be little interest in attempting this strategy.  Even Libya which is still fraught with political upheaval has re-entered the oil market with substantial sales.  Even with a solid pledge, it is very risky to stage a production cut in the midst of an oil glut.  \n \n Even if oil prices drop further, the ability to sustain loses between now and November 27 (just about a month away) would not require OPEC to change its position.  The market may self-heal (though unlikely) or further reductions may knock out competition. Their espoused policy of no production cuts will take some time to evaluate.\n \n For all of these reasons, I think the likelihood of OPEC cuts before Nov 27 is quite low and will begin with a probability of 15% while following the course of the market and politics closely.  \n ",

        "Following teammates\n Striver's analysis and references are outstanding and fully support the low likelihood prediction he has provided. Europe, including its economic key player, Germany have been hurt significantly in the reverberations from Russian intervention in Ukraine.  The key factor leading to that intervention was Ukraine's move toward the EU and NATO...both unacceptable to Putin.  The same outcome occurred when Georgia made similar moves to join the Western orbit.  \n \n I believe that the hope among all parties (Russia, Europe and the U.S.) seems to rest on stabilizing the current situation and stepping back from both sanctions and continued violence.  It's often said that the definition of \"crazy\" is doing the same things over and over again and expecting a different outcome.  In this case, any near-term move by NATO to provide a MAP for additional membership would fall into the \"crazy\" category.  It would be deemed provocative and would be quite inconsistent with Western sanctions placed on Russia (to date) which have been relatively benign. \n \n While NATO has done some sabre rattling about setting up a rapid reaction force to blunt a Russian invasion, this type of positioning is consistent with the public show of strength by the parties but doesn't actually pose a perceive geo-political threat to Russia.  Moving toward new NATO MAP alliances does pose that threat.   \n \n While a MAP offer may still occur in the future, it would seem that it will take at least until May 2015 to simply de-escalate the current level of upheaval.

        "The article below highlights some of the issues suggesting that a negative report is looming for the third quarter:  http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/10/economist-explains-14\n \n \"IN THE second quarter of this year the German economy shrank by 0.2%. Economists expect it to contract again in the third quarter, meaning that the economy will technically be in recession.\"\n \n The underlying reasoning rests in the significant portion of Germany's GDP that is dependent on exports.\n \n \"The German economy is powered by exports. Its current-account balance (the difference between the money it receives from the outside world and what it spends abroad) is one of the world's largest, at 7% of GDP. It is an open economy: its ratio of exports to GDP is double China's. So when Germany's exports fall by 6%, as they did in August, you know it is bad news. In recent months the global economy has turned against Germany. About 6% of German exports go to China, especially what economists call \"capital\" goods such as heavy machinery. China's economy is slowing: in 2010 GDP growth was 10% but this year it will be more like 7%. What is more, China is rebalancing away from investment-which requires capital goods-towards consumption, which does not. Germany has also been hit by slow growth in the 17 other euro-zone countries, where it sends 40% of its exports. To add to this mess, Russia, which takes 3% of Germany's exports, is facing a full-blown economic crisis as low oil prices and Western sanctions hit home.\"\n \n Germany has, up until now, maintained a rigid policy of avoiding debt to create stimulus and has remained indifferent to the downturns in the other nations within the Eurozone.  It appears, however, that this downturn, coupled with declining demand from China and the effects of sanctions over the Russia/Ukraine situation, are all taking a significant toll on German exports.  Unemployment in Germany rose in September and the government also projected a reduction in annual economic growth from 1.8% to 1.2% for 2014. German consumer sentiment indices have also gone down.\n \n In the 2nd quarter, Germany's GDP exhibited negative growth of .2% and it would appear that economic conditions have continued to deteriorate since then.  Also, most recently, there has been some indication that Merkel's position on stimulus and attention to the Eurozone has begun to shift albeit slightly.  After an extended period of rigidity in reaction to Europe's sliding towards recession, even a modest shift may indicate recognition by Merkel of the impact that the surrounding economies are now having on Germany and that economic reports for the third quarter (yet unpublished) will require more aggressive political/economic action.  \n \n For all of these reasons, I think there will be a report of negative GDP for the third quarter and will continue to monitor the economic reports.",

The military had to act to prevent a sharia law dominated society.  This does not mean that the military will preclude political parties rooted in religion.  To do so would condemn the country to internal violence for decades as the Mulsim Brotherhood will not go away.  I believe instead the focus will (should) be on drafting a constitution which ensures separation of powers so that should a religious based political party come to power, they will not be able to take over all of the government and democratic processes can be sustained.

        "I don't know if anyone else subscribes to Financial Times so I am copying the article I read to here: (very interesting!)\n \n For critics of the Kremlin, there's a delicious irony in this tale\n \n A general view of the headquarters of Russian gas giant Gazprom during the company's Annual General Meeting of shareholders in Moscow in this June 29, 2012 file photo. As bankers, traders and investors gathered at Gazprom's London offices for its annual champagne reception, the message from the world's most powerful gas trader was clear: the Russians don't want another gas war with Ukraine. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/Files (RUSSIA - Tags: BUSINESS ENERGY POLITICS)(C)Reuters\n \n In November 2005, a pipeline called Blue Stream was inaugurated to bring Russian gas across the Black Sea to Turkey. It was, said President Vladimir Putin, who attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony, \"just the start\".\n \n Mr Putin envisaged another Black Sea pipeline from Russia: a longer and more ambitious one, making landfall in Bulgaria and providing a handy southern conduit for Russian gas to the Balkans and eastern Europe - bypassing troublesome Ukraine. South Stream was born.\n \n With Kremlin backing, this \u00e2\u0082\u00ac15bn project always looked like a dead cert. But its future is looking increasingly murky. South Stream has become one of the biggest casualties of the east-west stand-off over Ukraine. There is now potential for huge delays. Sceptics wonder whether it will happen at all.\n \n In many ways, the project has become a symbol of the hardening of attitudes between Moscow and Brussels since the start of the Ukraine crisis. A cautious but heartfelt rapprochement has been replaced by tit-for-tat sanctions, asset freezes and visa bans. Russian-European co-operation on energy is now a pipe dream.\n \n For critics of the Kremlin, there's a delicious irony in this tale. Moscow has long been accused by the west of using its energy exports as a political weapon. With one of its pet projects now ensnared in EU bureaucracy, it's finally getting a taste of its own medicine.\n \n South Stream once seemed to have impeccable logic. After pricing disputes with Kiev in 2006 and 2009 led to cuts in supply to its European customers, Gazprom had been desperate to reduce its dependence on the Ukrainian gas transit system. South Stream bypassed Ukraine entirely. But even before Russia annexed Crimea in March, many in Brussels were beginning to worry that it would cement Gazprom's domination of the European gas market. Others feared it would leave Ukraine dangerously exposed: once South Stream was built, Gazprom could switch off supplies to its western neighbour without inconveniencing its other European customers.\n \n Those Brussels worries have now hardened into outright opposition. The European Commission is insisting that other gas suppliers be given access to South Stream. It says the idea of Gazprom both providing the gas and owning the pipeline through which it flows contravenes the EU's \"third energy package\" - and, these days, Brussels is in no mood to grant Gazprom an exemption.\n \n Attempts to reach a solution have failed. The commission recently suspended talks aimed at bringing South Stream into line with EU laws. It has forced Bulgaria to freeze construction work on its section of the pipeline and is also investigating whether Sofia breached EU competition rules in the way it awarded South Stream-related contracts. One beneficiary, Stroytransgaz, had to pull out after its owner Gennady Timchenko was hit by western sanctions.\n \n Gazprom insists the project remains on track. It has used its commercial muscle to exploit divisions between regulators and energy groups eager to maintain close ties with Russia - signing deals with Allseas Group and Saipem to build the offshore parts of the pipeline, and with Austria's OMV to build a spur from the Hungarian border to a gas hub near Vienna.\n \n But delays seem inevitable. Brussels-watchers say negotiations over a third-party waiver - allowing Gazprom to operate the pipeline exclusively - could take years, despite heavy lobbying by companies with stakes in the project, such as Eni. And Gazprom is already being investigated by the commission over alleged anti-competitive practices.\n \n Meanwhile, there are big doubts about South Stream's commercial logic. The project was always driven more by politics than business and, with gas demand still slack in Europe - partly due to the huge surge in renewables and cheap coal from the US - Gazprom may not even need the pipeline. Ilya Zaslavskiy, of think-tank Chatham House, says the company already has 100bn cubic metres per annum of spare export capacity, which could rise to at least 160bcma if South Stream is built. It would, he says, be a \"commercial disaster for the Russian budget\".\n \n If Brussels blocks the pipeline, it may therefore do Gazprom a favour. The company would be forced to behave in a more commercial way, ditching its plans for an expensive boondoggle where an alternative - the Ukrainian gas transit system - exists, and diverting the funds to more pressing projects such as domestic infrastructure and an export pipeline to China.

        "An excellent, comprehensive (if lengthy) analysis here: http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42784.pdf. I think China is well aware (particularly given the 2009 Impeccable incident) of how the US would react to a clear hostile act, and I simply don't seem them being that provocative, given their track record of \"salami-slicing\" - engaging in a series of acts that singly are no more than bothersome, but collectively and over time, assert dominant power over the region and pressure other countries to retreat from claimed maritime boundaries. Chinese-Japanese interactions are a bit more interesting, given the rising tensions over the Senkaku Islands and the recent incident where a Chinese frigate locked weapons-targeting radar on a Japanese destroyer (typically seen internationally as a hostile act).  However even in that incident, there was no attempt to threaten the Japanese vessel or to attempt to cause a collision - as one certainly could argue happened in the 2009 Impeccable situation. Final thought, despite the \"pivot to the Pacific\", in the era of budget cuts and sequestration, I don't see extra money being spent on testing China's willingness to \"enforce\" their EEZ by conducting any more US Navy patrols or transits than necessary in the disputed waters. Which is a lengthy way of saying I agree with the consensus here; I find this unlikely unless either Japan or the US did something provocative - and even then I don't think this is exactly the way China would respond.

This time they are not expected to play their usual role.\n \n With the increase in US shale oil output, Saudi Arabia's exports to the US have been falling off and they need to find new markets, particularly in Asia, at a time when worldwide demand is reducing due to weakening economies in Europe and Asia in particular. The Saudis have signalled their intention to compete on market share by reducing prices by a dollar a barrel every month for the last four months. This has triggered a much bigger fall in the spot markets.\n \n Apart from economics, there is also a geopolitical angle. While the Saudis and UAE can tolerate $80-90 prices and more or less remain within their current budget, and have enough reserves to last out a longer price war, countries like Russia (and Iran along with others such as Venezuela) are much more dependent on oil income. It is in the interest of both the US and Saudi Arabia to pressure the Russian and Iranian economies right now (The collapse of the Soviet Union is often attributed, certainly within Russia, to the last time the Saudis pumped more oil and reduced prices to $10 per barrel).\n \n An even more interesting point that the Saudis must be considering is that at current prices, further expansion of shale oil in the US and other countries may not be feasible, which is another reason why they are likely to oppose any cut in production quotas.",

        "This is unlikely for the following reasons:\n \n Historically:\n a)Crimea has been Russian for 3 centuries when Khrushchev transferred it to Ukraine on 19 February 1954.

So He will probably continue to maintain some tension, hopefully, without crossing the \"red line\".\n b)Externally, Putin is isolated.

        "This is a battle between Price and Market share. that is, sacrifice price to retain market share or profit from price and sacrifice market share. If OPEC cuts production, it is likely that US shale oil will keep chugging along and thus neutralize the production cuts, as well as take market share away from OPEC. \n \n If OPEC does not cut production, prices will sink, and likely will make Shale oil production a less attractive venture. The key question is: what is that price threshold that will make US shale oil to feel unattractive? \n \n This article (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-15/opec-finding-u-s-shale-harder-to-crack-as-rout-deepens.html) has some answers along those lines: \"About 2.6 million barrels of daily production, or 2.8 percent of global output, requires an oil price of $80 a barrel or more to be profitable, the IEA said. Only about 4 percent of U.S. shale output needs prices above that level, it said. Canadian synthetic oil projects are the most dependent on high prices, with about a quarter needing oil to remain above $80, the agency said.Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in hydrocarbon-rich underground shale layers have helped U.S. oil production grow 65 percent in the past five years to the highest level since 1986. That's reduced crude imports by more than 3.1 million barrels a day since peaking in 2005. Production per well was projected to increase in fields in North Dakota, Texas and Colorado, the Energy Information Administration said yesterday. Companies are getting more oil per dollar spent drilling, driving costs down by as much as $30 a barrel since 2012, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Longson said in a report Oct. 13.\" \n \n Thus due to American ingenuity (GO USA!) we are producing more profitable oil. I believe that the only rational course for OPEC given that oil production is actually slated to increase in the US and other non-OPEC producers is to battle it out with price rather than quantity. Thus I think that OPEC would let prices sink rather than cut production in the short term. \n \n See this article for more analysis along these lines: (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/13/us-oil-saudi-policy-idUSKCN0I201Y20141013)\n \"Saudi Arabia is quietly telling the oil market it would be comfortable with much lower oil prices for an extended period, a sharp shift in policy that may be aimed at slowing the expansion of rival producers including those in the U.S. shale patch. Some OPEC members including Venezuela are clamoring for production cuts to push oil prices back up above $100 a barrel.\n But Saudi officials have given a different message in meetings with investors and analysts: the kingdom, OPEC's largest producer, will accept oil prices below $90 per barrel, and perhaps down to $80, for as long as a year or two, according to people who have been briefed on the recent conversations.\n The discussions, some in New York over the past week, offer the clearest sign yet that the kingdom is setting aside its longstanding de facto aim of holding prices at around $100 a barrel for Brent crude LCOc1 in favor of retaining market share in years to come.\n The Saudis appear to be betting lower prices - which could strain the finances of some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - will be necessary to pave the way for higher revenue in the medium term, by curbing new investment and further increases in supply from places like the U.S. shale patch or ultra-deepwater, according to the sources, who declined to be identified due to the private nature of the discussions.\n The conversations with Saudi officials did not offer any specific guidance on whether - or by how much - the kingdom might agree to cut output, a move many analysts are expecting in order to shore up a global market that is producing substantially more crude than it can consume. Saudi Arabia pumps around a third of OPEC's oil, or about 9.7 million barrels a day.\n Asked about coming Saudi output curbs, one Saudi official responded \"What cuts?\", according to one of the sources.\n Also uncertain is whether the Saudi briefings to oil market observers represent a new tack it is committed to, or a talking point meant to cajole other OPEC members to join Riyadh in eventually tightening the taps on supply.\n One source not directly involved in the discussions said the kingdom does not necessarily want prices to slide further, but is unwilling to shoulder production cuts unilaterally and is prepared to tolerate lower prices until others in OPEC commit to action.\n \n OPEC ANGST\n With most other members of the cartel unable or unwilling to reduce their own output, the group's next meeting on Nov. 27 is set to be its most difficult in years. OPEC has agreed to cut production only a handful of times in the past decade, most recently in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n On Friday, Venezuela - one of the cartel's most price-sensitive members - became the first to call openly for emergency action even earlier. Foreign Minister Rafael Ramirez said \"it doesn't suit anyone to have a price war, for the price to fall below $100 a barrel\".\n On Sunday, Ali al-Omair, oil minister of Saudi Arabia's core Gulf ally Kuwait, appeared to be the first to articulate the emerging view of OPEC's most influential member, saying output cuts would do little to prop up prices in the face of rising production from Russia and the United States.\n \"I don't think today there is a chance that (OPEC) countries would reduce their production,\" state news agency KUNA quoted him as saying.\n Omair said that prices should stop falling at around $76 to $77 a barrel, citing production costs in places such as the United States, where a shale oil boom has unexpectedly reversed dwindling output and pushed production to its highest level since the 1980s.\n Saudi oil officials have made no public comments on the deepening swoon in markets. Senior officials did not reply to questions from Reuters about recent briefings.\n \n DON'T BE SURPRISED BELOW $90\n Global benchmark Brent LCOc1 crude oil futures have fallen steadily for almost four months, dropping 23 percent from a June high of over $115 a barrel as fears of a Mideast supply disruption ebbed, U.S. shale production boomed and demand from Europe and China showed signs of flagging. [O/R]\n Brent fell below $88 a barrel on Monday, hitting its lowest in almost four years, after news of the Saudi and Kuwaiti statements.\n \"In light of these comments, one should not expect any OPEC output cuts before the Nov. 27 meeting,\" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo.\n An OPEC delegate from outside the core Gulf Arab group said he did not think OPEC would cut output at the November meeting but added he believed the Saudis should cut output unilaterally:\n \"The question should be posed to Saudi Arabia\".\n The growing difference in opinions means OPEC is heading for its most tense meeting since mid-2011 when it failed to agree on an increase in output despite a loss of Libyan production.\n Until recently, Gulf OPEC members have been saying that the price dip was a temporary phenomenon, betting on seasonal demand in winter to prop up prices. But a growing number of oil analysts now see the latest slide as something more than a seasonal downswing; some say it is the start of a pivotal shift to a prolonged period of relative abundance.\n Rather than fight the decline in prices and cede market share in the face of growing competition, Saudi Arabia appears to be preparing traders for a sea change in prices.\n The Saudis want the world to know that \"nobody should be surprised\" with oil under $90 a barrel, according to one of the people. Another source suggested that $80 a barrel may now be an acceptable floor for the kingdom, although several other analysts said that figure seemed too low. Brent has averaged around $103 since 2010, trading mostly between $100 and $120.\n While the latest discussions are the bluntest efforts yet to signal the shift in Saudi strategy, early signs had already begun sending shivers through the oil market. In early October the kingdom cut its official selling prices more sharply than expected in a bid to maintain customers in Asia, widely seen as the opening shots in a price war for Asian customers.\n \"Riyadh's political floor on oil prices is weakening,\" Robert McNally, a White House adviser to former President George W. Bush and president of the Rapidan Group energy consultancy, wrote in a note to clients following a trip to Saudi last month.\n McNally said he is not aware of any specific Saudi price or timing strategy, but told Reuters that Saudi Arabia \"will accept a price decline necessary to sweat whatever supply cuts are needed to balance the market out of the U.S. shale oil sector.\"\n As that message began to dawn last week, the price rout quickened, with Brent lurching to its lowest level since 2010.\n \"Until about three days ago the absolute and total consensus in the market was the Saudis would cut,\" said McNally. That is no longer a foregone conclusion, he said. \"The market suddenly realizes it is operating without a net.\"",

The criteria that will determine whether or not the RMB will be part of the SDR is whether it is  \"freely usable\".\n See page 17 at\n http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2010/102610.pdf\n \n \"Article XXX(f) defines it as a currency that (i) is, in fact, widely used to make payments for international transactions, and (ii) is widely traded in the principal exchange markets. Rule O-3 provides that the Fund shall determine the currencies that are freely usable in accordance with Article XXX(f) and that it shall consult a member before placing its currency on, or removing it from, the list of freely usable currencies.\"\n \n In 1977, staff proposed the following criteria for determining which currencies are freely usable:\n (i) the assessment of the use of a currency for international transactions should be based on the extent to which trade in goods and services is paid for in that currency, as well as on the relative volume of capital transactions denominated in that currency.\n (ii) the assessment of whether a currency was widely traded in the principal foreign exchange markets should be based on the volume of transactions, the existence of forward markets, and the spread between buying and selling quotations for transactions denominated in that currency.\"\n \n ****\n Now, in the last five years, China has started to get some of its trade denominated in RMB. So I think it comes down to whether there is a sufficiently deep market for it or not. I will dig around to figure it out. \n \n Also, the IMF is supposed to inform the member if it determines the currency to be \"freely traceable\". So we should get advance indication when that occurs. \n \n I suspect that RMB will be in the SDR, but that will not happen before June 10.",

There have been recent satellite surveillance  reports of activity at Parchin--seen as possible pre- inspection clean up operations. Given that an all clear IAEA report is both a must and  the least politically costly way of backing off for Tehran, an IAEA inspection of Parchin must now be on the table and seem quite likely within this time frame.",
        "Hukou system by which social services including health and education and work permits provided by the city and the municipal governments can only be accessed by those officially designated as residents of those cities is being increasingly criticized from a human rights perspective as an unfair and archaic system. However, hukou is used in China by the national and local authorities to control the distribution of the population and the influx of migrant population from rural to urban centers and particularly mega cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.  despite all the criticisms leveled against the system very powerful socio-political interests, such as mega cities that worry about huge uncontrolled migration and sudden increase in their population, as well as the city dwellers worried about the erosion in the quality of services, are firmly and loudly against wholesale nationwide changes in the system. (mayor of Beijing warning that Beijing with a population of 20 million cannot handle an influx of another 20 million) some reforms are being undertaken by the local authorities in major cities and there seems to be a shared awareness that such system will eventually need major reform, but timeline being talked about is 15 years.  China has a history of decentralizing change and proceeding cautiously on anything that might create social unrest. The consensus opinion on such an announcement seems to tilt towards less likely and south of 50-50.  I will begin by assigning an opening 30% probability to give us a better score and adjust as I find out more. I will also be on the lookout for other forecasts that might improve on this.",

The latest available data is from August 21, and the two curves have started approaching each other again.

        "The growth rate for the second quarter of 2014 was negative, and the expert forecasts since then have switched from optimism to pessimism and back to slight optimism about the third quarter. The stark decline in exports and industrial production, partly due to the crisis in Ukraine, have been counteracted by growing consumer demand, low energy prices, and a continuation of the expansive monetary policy. Industrial production in August was very weak, but part of the reason for this was the timing of school holidays. The situation in Ukraine appears somewhat stable at the moment. The IFO index continues to be low, but probably not low enough for a recession. Because the third quarter is already over, wildcards  should not come into play. Once more indicators for the third quarter become available, I will update my forecast. At the moment I expect growth to be near but above zero.",
        "In the longer term, a referendum on independence seems much more likely than in the shorter term. Barzani has been pushing a referendum recently and a commission has been formed, but it seems unlikely that a referendum can be held while the armed conflict in the region is still going on. With increased foreign support it is possible that IS will be defeated, but it's not clear how long that will take. And even after a military defeat of IS, a referendum process could still be interfered with through terrorist acts. On the other hand, a victory over IS might fuel Kurdish nationalism and make a referendum more likely. Turkey's position remains to be seen: While there has been less opposition to independence lately, a now strongly armed Kurdish state might seem less desirable by Ankara. Finally, it remains an open question how much the Kurdish leadership actually wants a referendum versus using the threat of one to gain concessions from the government in Baghdad. \n \n Overall this prediction is uncertain, as war situations tend to have many unknowns.",

( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/23/us-russia-investment-ukraine-idUSBRE98M11520130923 ). Additionally, shutting the gas off hurts Russia too; while imposing import duties on the 60% of Ukrainian exports that go to Russia only hurts Ukraine.   Plus, Ukraine and other countries in Europe haave shale gas in is in process of extracting it. This is in part motivating by their dependence on Russian gas and Russia's proclivity for abusing their leverage. If Russia shut the gas off now they would only speed up this process and push Ukraine further towards the EU and sour a perfectly good market for their gas.",
        "Gchine is a contentious issue because it was suspected of being a place of plutonium experiments. However, I doubt Iran would have entered this deal without having either gotten clemency for suspected experiments or cleaned up the experiments enough where the inspectors would not be able to draw a clear conclusion.   The framework itself does not mention Gchine specifically, but does include language around having access to 'uranium mines'. It is mentioned in the story in the news feed that Gchine may be visited in February. However, Iran has already pushed back a meeting with IAEA that was scheduled for 21 Jan 2014. Either way, this is moving at breakneck pace which suggests that Iran has hidden all its bomb related stuff and needs to have the sanctions lifted or really is willing to move forward with peaceful nuclear power. In any case, the Gchine mine is on the radar and there seems no reason it wouldn't be visited. I think when is the question; I'm cautiously optimistic that things will move smoothly, assuming the next meeting isn't pushed back.",
        "Iran elected a 'moderate' President and he in turn nominated a female technocratic vice president. The president himself was a chief nuclear negotiator for Iran. The president has also nominated a physicist, who is also a permanent representative of Iran to the (IAEA) and the most recent foreign minister, to head the Atomic Energy Ornization of Iran. Middle east peace talks will commence very soon in Jerusalem, this probably wouldn't have happened without blessing from Iran. Seems like Iran is gearing up for negotiations. If they wanted to actually allow inspection and hide their nuclear program they've nominated the right person. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Akbar_Salehi )  Question is whether they want to negotiate as a stalling tactic in order to ease some pressure on their economy while they get to the home stretch of building a viable bomb, or do they want to put people in place that can negotiate the best deal while knowing how to hide the program because it is too far away from being viable that their economy could withstand the impact of sanctions, or do they really want to have a peaceful nuclear program and will allow inspections to show it. I think the first option is the most likely given comments of intelligence community recently.  I think the condition is relevant and if it passes will put more pressure on the Iranian government. However, I think if it passes it represent a deterioration of dialogue between Iran and the west, especially in the short term. If Iran is gearing up to come to the table, I think the administration would ask the democratically controlled senate to hold up on passing in order no to soil the waters.",
        "There is a lot of talk around this, mostly from Iran, but Assad did mention Golan Heights in a recent interview which is considered to be Syrian territory that is to be controlled until negotiated settlement is reached between Israel and Syria. I've asked for clarification from GJP because this is the most likely point in which Syria would attack Israel. Aside from that I have trouble seeing Syria send rockets or mount an offensive towards Israel.  What exactly does Assad get out of attacking Israel? Its useful as a deterring threat before the fact, but what happens to Syria when the US commits a missile strike and then Syria attacks Israel in some way. Then Syria is likely attacked by Israel in a large way. Then Assad is left with a choice of simply taking the Israeli attack on the chin or escalating the conflict; at which point he is fighting two wars. Not to mention the fact that this puts even greater pressure on his allies. Its seems that the coalition wanting to strike Syria for use of chemical weapons would create enough consensus that would make it hard for Syrian allies to justify supporting Syria if they attacked Israel. If Assad really wanted to give himself the best chance of staying in power, I don't think he wants to attack Israel. However, if he wanted to stay in power he wouldn't have used chemical weapons.",

This was the purpose of Obama's speech in Estonia a couple of weeks ago, yet a few days after it Russian FSB operatives kidnapped an Estonian security official on Estonia soil.\n \n Nine months is a long time but NATO needs first to push back against Putin in his threats to actual members. If he shows weakness in the face of this, and some Russia watchers speculate that he has a bully mentality and as such will back down if challenged, then there is the opportunity to extent MAP to fringe nations.\n \n The follow up question is do you open MAP with all three countries (the political approach) or just one at a time based more on military logic. If so, Moldova would be the most plausible of the three - although its forthcoming elections could see it pulled more into Russia's orbit anyway.\n \n For me, the chances are currently low. The political leadership of NATO are not interested in taking risks.",

This is their method to do so. \n \n They have already done the nuclear power plant for attention and that fizzled, now if they couple that with a long range test throw in some rhetoric about how they have the \"bomb\" and it works thanks to their firing up of their research facility that would probably pull attention their way for a bit.",

As there is nothing but a bunch of mainstream media on the subject with their \"so called experts\" who are always drummed up to paint a terrible picture to get a mouse click. \n \n I don't really see us or anyone else mobilizing against ISIS. If a country were to help Bashar's army and it was in fact determined that he used chemical weapons.. that would be really bad. If a country helped the rebels and it turned out they used chemical weapons that would also be bad.\n \n This combined with previous, and as far as I can tell still standing, warnings from Russia to not get involved in Syria. So because the US supports the rebels and Russia supports Bashar unless one of the aforementioned switches sides (politcal nightmare for them), than most likely neither country will get involved. Russia is playing a dangerous game as it is. Putin is a master with this and in this particular game of chess I don't see Syria as being worth the risk.  \n \n The focus on Iraq will continue policy makers know that if they can break ISIS in Iraq there is a high potential the rest will fall as well. Why risk getting involved when you may be able to take out two birds with one stone. \n \n In short we continue to assist in Iraq, it plays into our regional plan/desire anyway, leave Syria for now.\n \n As far as wild cards, you never know what Isreal or Iran will do so yea...",

The world is still trying to prove that russian fighters were involved with the start to the whole Crimea thing. Even though we have pretty much proven it Russia never took responsibility.  \n \n Putin will play the wasn't us card for as long as he can. Even with one of his soldiers posting on social media confirming his involvement, the post was simply deleted. Provided that he is able to pass responsibility to the insurgents and cast any level of doubt on his involvement he will. \n \n Even though we \"know\" it was them, if they say it wasn't us proving it in the time frame is unlikely, unless we get lucky.\n \n I whole heartedly believe that such a low threshold will be met, I do not believe it will be pinned on Russian national military forces, regardless of their involvement, unless Ukraine fights back which opens another instance that it doesn't want as that would result in Russia openly retaliating and leaving the UN with tied hands.",

Many Egyptians, who were happy to see an end to Morsi's Islamist rule, believe a firm hand is needed to steer the country through crisis and are calling for Sisi to run for president. ",
        "ref:  http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=08f1a650-7578-49bd-b392-8ba756da1a00  Jiang Jiemin, the current head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) is currently under investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection for \"suspected serious disciplinary violations\". . . . As a member of the Central Committee, Jiemin is one of the most senior officials to be targeted since President Xi Jinping came to power.  Reports have been made that retired security chief Zhou Yongkang, who stepped down last year from the Politburo Standing Committee, is under investigation for fraud, following investigations into Jiang Jiemin. . . If prosecuted, the case will mark the first time a Politburo Standing Committee member, retired or sitting, has ever been investigated for crimes of an economic nature.  Given that info, and based on what I learned while following the Bo Xilai trial/verdict/sentence, I gather that the way a new leader like Jinping consolidates power in China is through charging them with corruption.  As we saw with Bo, the charges are first leveled against underlings, outliers, peripheral people, one by one, (his wife, son, the police chief, etc) until there is nobody left to support the REAL target--the person who is perceived as a threat.  Therefore, I look for more \"investigations\", followed by charges, until all who perceived as threats by Xi Jinping are neutralized/in prison.",

Thirty years ago this month, Britain and China signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, under which London agreed to restore Hong Kong to China in 1997 and Beijing spelled out its policy of \"one country two systems\" for the then-British colony, which would \"enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defense affairs which are the responsibilities of the Central People's Government\" for 50 years, that is, until 2047.\n \n In July, the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee announced that it would conduct an inquiry into the United Kingdom's relations with Hong Kong. According to the committee, the inquiry will consider how the British government monitors the implementation of the Joint Declaration, as well as the UK's relations with Hong Kong, including economic and cultural ties.\n \n Last week, the committee ran into a brick wall. China told the committee its members would be denied visas for Hong Kong.\n \n This is the first time that any country - including China - had banned Members of Parliament from conducting a visit as part of an inquiry.\n \n But more is at stake than the pride of British M.P.'s. In announcing the ban China in effect asserted that the Joint Declaration \"is now void and only covered the period from the signing in 1984 until the handover in 1997.\"\n \n If true, that is very troubling since the Joint Declaration made it clear that China's commitment was to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy until 2047. That is to say, the Joint Declaration, an international treaty lodged with the United Nations, will not lapse until then.\n \n For China to declare that the treaty is now void is tantamount to unilaterally abrogating a treaty. It calls to mind words spoken by then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Hong Kong in 1982, after her meeting with paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in Beijing.\n \n The Iron Lady said: \"If a country will not stand by one treaty, it would not stand by another treaty.\" Speaking about the UK, she said, \"We stick by our treaties.\"\n \n COMMENT:  The UK says that this isn't just about refusing to issue visas,  it's about if China sticks by its treaties, so the question has huge ramifications.  I hope that face-saving ways are found to resolve it, like maybe allowing only ONE member of Parliament to enter.\n \n I'm front-loading this IFP.  Realistically, I think that the likelihood is only about 70%, but I know very little, and it could close tomorrow.",
        "http://english.capital.gr/News.asp?id=2270199\n \n Approval rates for Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff have reached historic lows amid economic troubles and a corruption scandal, reducing her chances of approving austerity measures in Congress.\n \n A new poll released Wednesday showed that only 12% of 2,002 respondents across the country said Ms. Rousseff's administration was \"good or excellent,\" compared with 40% in a poll published in December, while 64% considered her administration \"bad,\" up from 27% in December.\n \n The poll's result is the lowest for any president since 1995, the oldest data immediately available from CNI. It comes after massive protests that brought more than a million Brazilians to the streets in March to protest against corruption and other issues.\n \n The protests may have \"contaminated the results,\" said CNI Survey Manager Renato da Fonseca.\n \n The poll, though, reinforces a downward trend in approval rates showed by other recent surveys, and adds to a difficult period for the leader of Latin America's largest economy.\n \n It comes in the wake of a tight and tense election in October, when Ms. Rousseff narrowly won a second four-year term amid economic weakness, high inflation and a widening budget gap that made credit-rating agencies put Brazil on watch for a downgrade to junk status.\n \n But the economy isn't the only problem. In fact, the poll showed that news about investigations of alleged corruption at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled oil company known as Petrobras, was cited by 28% of respondents, making it the leading theme in their minds. Inflation, the leading economic theme, was mentioned by 4% of the sample.\n \n Prosecutors say that billions of dollars were skimmed from Petrobras by executives who funneled part of the allegedly illegal proceeds back to government-supporting parties. Ms. Rousseff was energy minister and Petrobras chairwoman for much of that period, before becoming Brazil's president and has said she didn't know about the alleged wrongdoing.\n \n Although she hasn't been implicated in the investigations, high-profile politicians linked to the Workers' Party have. Opposition parties have called for Ms. Rousseff's impeachment.\n \n It is also possible that Ms. Rousseff's rates have hit bottom. CNI's Mr. Fonseca said that he \"won't be surprised\" if the next poll in June shows a recovery in Ms. Rousseff's ratings. \"The evaluation is too low. The result was inflated by the street protests,\" he said.\n \n But the result poses new challenges for a president who will be struggling to establish her legacy in the next four years.\n \n As she started the new term in January, the economy was heading to recession and consumer-price increases neared 8%. Interest rates are now at 12.75% and rising.\n \n The re-elected president called on a conservative banker, Joaquim Levy, to run the Finance Ministry and increase government savings, something the government hopes will help tame inflation.\n \n While many of her critics were pleasantly surprised by the leftist leader's about-face, the move upset many of her voters who believed her Workers' Party would double down on a policy of heavy government spending to pump up growth.\n \n Among respondents who said they voted for Ms. Rousseff, only 22% now say her government is good, compared with 63% in December, right before the austerity measures kicked in. In the same group, 42% said they trust the president, down from 80% in December.\n \n Mr. Levy has acted to increase taxes and cut spending. But some of the new measures need lawmakers' approval, something that is harder to obtain when the president has such low approval rates.\n \n \"During the campaign, [Ms. Rousseff] said things that are the opposite of what we see her doing now.  The people don't forgive\" this type of behavior.\n \n \"When you lose people's approval, government allies start to jump ship.\n \n COMMENT:  Rousseff's selection of Levy for Finance Minister seems to have been a good one, and an invitation to the US by Obama may give her a big boost.  I need to research the history of coups and impeach\u0010ments\u0010 in Brazil, however.\n \n I don't think that this is going to happen, but this is one of those questions that it pays to front-load, so I'll say 50%\n \n  \n ",

In the past, violence in north Kosovo has been in response to specific events, most significantly the deployment of Kosovar police to border crossings in North Kosovo in 2011. If violence does occur, I think it's more likely to be in response to a non-election event. Second, the Serbian government seems happy with the results of the election, including the victory of the party seen as sympathetic to the Serbian government in Serb-majority areas of Kosovo. While the relationship between the Serbian government and violent actors in northern Kosovo is murky, the two groups have moved together in the past, except when northern Kosovo starts to feel abandoned by Serbia.

        "China has in the past always maintained that both Paracel and Spratley Islands are under their control. While the South China sea has seen much dispute over the conflict, one thing is apparent: None of the neighbors has the military power to challenge China's claims and China is not prone to bring the issue up for international arbitration because their claim not only includes the islands, but a very large area of the sea.\n The history of the conflict shows that China may have some merit in claiming the possession of the islands alone, but the vast inclusion of the waters beyond international boundaries touched a nerve.\n \n Buying a aircraft carrier from Russia, the continued hassles and incidents in the South China sea and finally the implementation of the ADIZ lately show the China is more confident that they are able to press the matter, even against US resistance.\n \n For the implementation of the ADIZ: It makes sense because\n - it has no firm international regulation\n - it will avoid or at least warn China for a possible new Hainan incident like\n   that in 2001.\n - it will foster the claims brought forward, so it is to be expected that the Paracel islands which are already settled will be included in the ADIZ.\n - China's global position has continually improved while the status of their opponents have deteriorated.\n \n Saying that, it is really difficult to estimate how China will react if their position is challenged by the USA.

        "We have a problem of propaganda from both sides.\n For example we have the problem that Ukraine claimed that a Russian military convoy entered Ukrainian territority on the night of August 15th, 2014. Russia denies this and further info is not vindicated.\n \n Ukraine:\n The Ukraine was always a bit divided: In the west the population was more affectionate for the west and the EU while in the east good connections to Russia was important. The politics reflected this: It was always a balancing act to fulfill both desires. After the Maidan revolution the balance moved completely to the West and therefore the growing tension and requests for separation in the eastern part is understandable.\n \n Russian view:\n Russia gets more and more the impression that it is painted as evil independent of what they do. The illegal deposition of the Ukrainian president and the participation of the violent and extremist Swoboda party is largely ignored in the Western media. That Ukraine is not able to pay their outstanding gas debts: ignored. The shots on the Maidan place was very likely done by Swoboda activists which Nuland in her \"Fuck the EU\" phone call mentioned. The shot down of flight MH-17 by a SAM missile was entirely blamed on the separatists while the exact cause and perpetrator is still unknown.\n Russia is sanctioned for...what exactly ? The suffering of the civilian population in Donezk during the heavy fights: ignored. NATO broke their word about eastern expansion. \n \n Russias point was always having a puffer state between them and NATO and only Belarus remains. If Russia gets the impression that they cannot do anything to stop further expansion this may be the final straw. \n \n Western view:\n None of the Western politicians make the impression that they understand Russias position. They all seem more interested to get Ukraine ready for joining the West. As the continued conflict threaten to divide the Ukraine (which would be further de-facto state like Transnistria, Abchazia and South Ossetia longing for Russian support) they all seem interested to build up a threat scenario to Russia to hamper Russian intervention in Ukraine, allowing a very bloody fight in the eastern part of Ukraine to suppress the independence streak as fast as possible.\n \n Analysis: Given that the tensions have so far only worsened between the West and Russia, I predict that a lethal confrontation will occur.\n ",

It has already respond to shelling of its territory by the syrian army at the begining of the war so there is some presedent.\n Israel may bomb the IS if it see it as a threat. The IS has been fighting in the golan heights, near the frontier of Israel, and sme spillover fighting could ingnite a response. The problem with this option is that Israel doesn't like to acknowledge their intervention in foregin countries unless it is too obious.\n Iran is a long time supporter of Assad, has provided him wiwth weapons and cash, and it is suspected with fighters. But again we encounter the problem of acknowledgement.\n Finaly the US. Obama vowed to destroy the IS and is already attacking them in Irak. The US is less likely to intervene in Syria, even after the Assad regime open itself to work with foregin countries agains the IS, because they don't want to appear alligned with the Assad regime, alienating the Sunnis even more.\n \n All that considered, even if each player has reasons to intervene and reasons to not do so, the large amount of enemies the IS has made makes them likely that someone will attack them (most likely throug airstrikes) in Syrian before the end of the year.\n Again, this is a first approach that could change with new developments and with new perspectives and information that i found.",

        "I'll state going in that this is a slightly trickier question for me to call, because I'd  prefer the result it describes over any other one, but I'll try and leave my personal bias at the door.\n \n This election is highly unusual in that the Liberal Democrats, a current coalition partner and the party who has most often swept up protest votes in the past, is trailing far behind in the polls.  Local constituency polls (like the ones here: http://lordashcroftpolls.com/constituency-polls/) suggest that they are likely to lose a lot of seats.\n \n Two new protest parties have risen to fill the gap: the Greens (who have been around forever, but have only recently started making big gains in the polls) and UKIP, who have also been around for a long time but who have seen slow and steady growth in their polling.  (The Greens have a single MP, elected in 2010; UKIP have 2, both defectors from the Conservatives who were subsequently reelected as UKIP MPs).\n \n The big question, as Ella highlights, is how the national polls will translate into changes at a local level.  Again, local polling is helpful, but to my mind there are three key personal / party issues that will decide the election for voters, and which may not be showing up in the polls:\n \n 1) Protest vs. Government: Protest parties invariably do better in the polls than they do when people are actually making a choice that will affect who governs them.  (As an example, the Lib Dems polled 4-5% lower, nationally, than the polls suggested they would beforehand - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010#2010).  Actually making a choice on polling day forces people to think harder about what they want and what they think would be best for the country - and Conservative slogans like, \"Vote UKIP, get Labour\" may have an impact here.\n \n 2) Tory Toxicity: Despite the efforts of some of the Conservative leadership over the past 10 years, the Tories are still seen by many as a toxic brand - The Nasty Party.  Uncaring and greedy, they will grind the faces of the poor into the dirt - that sort of thing.  Consequently, many people are still reluctant to admit voting for them - even when they may believe that they are the best choice for the country.  This is one of the potential explanations for the result of the 1992 General Election, where Labour held a led all the way to polling day, but then lost to the Conservatives.\n \n 3) A Suitable Executive: Brits vote for MPs, but almost everyone does so with an eye on who would assume the Executive powers of the country - in particular who would become the Prime Minister.  David Cameron continues to out-poll other party leaders on the question, \"Who would make the best Prime Minister?\" http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/leaders, while Ed Milliband is portrayed by the media in a very unfavourable light (search for Milliband Bacon Sandwich for examples) \n \n Potentially trumping all of these is the economy.  The Tories are still seen as the best economic managers, and the UK economy is showing promising signs of recovery.  Assuming that this recovery is sustained through to the election, then a reputation for economic competence may also drive a \"hold your nose and vote Tory\" attitude. \n \n Finally (and with apologies for the long answer), I'll try and offset some of my likely bias with a detailed analysis by a Conservative-supporting UK political analyst.  Based on local polling, plus his own knowledge of the lie of the land, he's predicting a very messy result - with Labour holding the most seats.  I think (perhaps wishfully) that he's interpreting the polls too rigidly, but I may well be wrong! http://www.iaindale.com/posts/2015/01/18/general-election-predictions-the-final-results-we-re-heading-for-a-three-party-coalition-or-a-second-election  \n \n \n (First prediction of 2015 - hopefully more to come this week!)",

To date none of these steps have taken place really except for the decision to have the HQ of the institution in Xangai.

        "Some objective facts:\n - Western countries will not intervene military to save Ukraine, probably not even in the face of a massive Russian invasion of the country\n - Russia military might far surpasses that of Ukraine\n - Russia is economically a midget compared to US-EU\n - US-EU economic sanctions can hurt Russia in a meaningful way\n - Ukraine is an economic disaster, and maybe also be so politically\n - Putins domestic popularity has climbed strongly following annexation of Crimea.\n \n Theories abound about Putin and his plans, or lack of plans. I think it is safe to say that we know that we do not know what Putin is up to.\n \n \"Mock\" referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk in May showed an overwhelming support for independence from Ukraine and possibly also willingness to be annexed by Russia.\n \n Russia continues to send vital humanitarian aid to eastern Ukraina, regardless of the cease fire, and without informing Red Cross as per agreement between Ukraine and Russia.\n \n Eastern Ukraine is of vital economic interest to Ukraine, and thus also Russia.\n \n Pro russian rebels appear fully capable of coordinated military action, and are likely supported in many ways by Russia (arms, men, intelligence and logistics). Government forces currently hold the airport in Donetsk, but we shouldnt be surprised if the rebels are able to overrun it.\n \n Russian gas supplies to Ukraine now come on a pre-paid basis. These supplies are vital to Ukraine and leaves the country in an interestingly difficult situation.\n \n While it is not given that Russia will annex additional territory in Ukraine just yet, it is certain that Ukraine faces a severe threath against its sovereignty that will at best erode the country gradually to submission (over decades). If Ukraine signals further steps to integrate with Europe, it will only heigthen Russias resolve to stop Ukraine from doing so. The situation of a \"frozen\" conflict appears to be Ukraines best hope for its future.\n \n To sum up, an annexation appears somewhat likely, as there is little to stop Russia from doing so. There is a limit to how large economic sanctions US-EU want to use right now, as they might need to be able to save the \"large guns\" for later as the situation develops. The next few weeks will probably be decisive. If Russia annexes Donetsk/Luhansk, what happens then?",

On the other side: In June 2014, diplomats from NATO suggested that while a MAP was unlikely, a package of \"reinforced cooperation\" agreements was a possible compromise.\n \n - So it appears unlikely that Georgia will be able to get a MAP within the time-frame, thus unlikely that any new countries will get MAP as well.",

        "As both Pedro and Kevin point out, the only real question seems to be timing, as both candidates have said that they intend to sign the agreement. Unlike Kevin and Pedro, however, I am a little more optimistic that the current election crises can be resolved and the security agreement signed in the next sixty days. \n \n Rough Timeline:\n \n September 10-12 - The Independent Election Commission (IEC) announces result of the vote audit. The IEC  is currently 80 per cent of the way through recounting votes. They project that they will be done the vote audit by September 10th. Further delays are unlikely, as both candidates have withdrawn observers, so there is little chance squabbling over procedure will slow the audit down. \n \n End of September - New government is sworn in. I don't anticipate much delay between the completion of the election audit and the swearing in of the new president. Per Article 6 of the Afghan Constitution, Karzai's term actually expired on the first of Jawza (which was a couple of months ago), and he seems eager to hand over authority.\n \n November - Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) is signed. Signing the BSA is a fairly symbolic gesture. It only commits Afghanistan from refraining, in good faith, from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty, pending full ratification. Signing treaties is also within the authority of the President. Per Article 90(5) of the Constitution, the National Assembly only needs to be involved at the ratification stage. \n \n Once sworn in, the new President will be under a fair bit of pressure to quickly sign the BSA. Both candidates have already endorsed it and both seem eager to secure the United State's continued support (both military and economic). Uncertainty about the future of the American presence have played havoc with the economy and bolstered the Taliban's morale. Signing the treaty would end this uncertainty. \n \n Memories of the disastrous result of the Soviet withdrawal in the late 80s are also likely to encourage the new president to sign the agreement.\n \n It also helps that the 2013 loya jirga (which was composed of most of the important political figures in Afghanistan) endorsed the wording of the agreement.\n \n Potential Spoilers:\n \n The biggest risk to this timeline is that the losing candidate won't accept the result of the vote audit, which might delay the swearing in of the new president. There is certainly some chance that this could happen. Abdullah Abdullah, the likely loser, has already withdrawn his observers from the election audit because of frustration over the criteria used to weed out fraudulent ballots. He might, as a result, not be willing to accept the IEC's recount. \n \n That being said, Abdullah Abdulla expressed the same concerns in the first round of the 2009 election (in which he also came second). and ultimately declined to go forward with a second round of balloting.\n \n Updating Strategy:\n \n If there are any delays to the timeline I've laid out, I plan on adjusting my prediction downward. If things go according to plan, I may adjust upwards. \n \n The candidates reaction to the IEC's election audit will be a particularly important moment. If the loser accepts the results, things are likely to go smoothly. If not, it becomes less likely that the BSA will be signed by the start of November. \n  \n Background Info: \n \n Afghan Constitution: \n - Article 64: The President shall have the following authorities and duties: (17) Issue credential letter for conclusion of international treaties in accordance with the provision of law. \n - Article 90: The national assembly shall have the following duties: (5) Ratification of international treaties and agreements, or abrogation of membership of Afghanistan in them \n \n November 2013 Loya Jirga\n - Karzai's own loya jirga endorsed the wording of the agreement and approved a resolution calling on the president to sign it. \n \n Sources:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/world/asia/afghan-council-approves-us-security-pact.html?pagewanted=all\n http://www.afghanembassy.com.pl/afg/images/pliki/TheConstitution.pdf",
        "As those below have noted, public polling coming out of Brazil seems to indicate that a runoff is highly likely. If the polls are accurate reflection of how voting will play out, Rousseff would have to gain 14% +1, in order to prevent a runoff, while the other candidates would have to pull in even more. The odds of such a big swing are fairly remote, given that all three candidates are established players with dedicated voting blocs. \n \n (based on a little digging, the polling coming out of Brazil tends to be okay, though not perfect. In 2010, for example, polls predicted Rousseff would get 52 per cent of the vote in the first round and she only ended up with 47 per cent)",
        "Historically speaking, military-to-military confrontations in the South China Sea have been exceedingly rare. Digging in to the Correlates of War's militarized interstate dispute dataset (http://www.correlatesofwar.org), I could only find a handful of incidents that would satisfy the conditions laid out in this question: \n \n - In 2001, a Chinese pilot died after colliding with a U.S. spy plane\n - In 1988, ~70 Vietnames sailors died after Chinese and Vietnamese forces clashed over Johnson South Reef\n - In 1974, ~70 sailors died as China seized the Paracel Islands from Vietnam \n \n Recently, however, tensions have been rising in the South China Sea and there have been a number of fatal clashes. Most of these clashes would not meet the criteria set out in this question though, as these incidents have been limited to confrontations between domestic law enforcement agencies (primarily the coast guard) and fishermen. \n \n Given the low baseline for military-to-miitary clashes in the South China Sea, I don't think its likely that we will see a planned military engagement in the South China Sea before June 2015. With so much military activity in the area though, there's always a chance for accidents (such as the 2001 collision between Chinese and US planes).",
        "Given the rather short time frame, starting at 10 per cent and planning on adjusting downward as time goes on. Couple of factors at play:\n \n The U.S. and its allies often do manage to track down big-name targets and either capture or kill them, but this rarely happens very quickly. Examples include Osama (of course), Adan Garar (one of the masterminds behind the Kenyan mall attack), and Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai (who was involved in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania). This obviously isn't a comprehensive list, but it took the U.S. over a decade to incapacitate Osama and Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai. They managed to track Garar down a little faster, but it still took over a year. \n \n Given the operational and legal difficulties of conducting strikes or capture operations in Syria (where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is probably hiding), it is unlikely that the U.S. or its allies will have the chance to incapacitate him in the next 60 days. \n \n The wildcard here is the ongoing Syrian civil war. There is always a chance that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi will get knocked off by a rival rebel group, one of his own commanders, or get caught by one of the Syrian government's indiscriminate bombing runs.",

The relationship with Russia is also reasonably good, so a visit is not impossible - but still unlikely.\n \n The article seems to regard the fact that president Xi visits South Korea before he visits the North as a deliberate snub. The South Korea meeting does make a North Korea meeting more likely for 2 reasons:\n 1. North Korea might want to re-assert itself as China's ally and become more pliable, which would make China more amenable to a meeting.\n 2. China might plan a meeting as an olive branch after the snub.\n \n \n A meeting with China therefore seems possible, but not that likely.\n \n The relationship between the North and the South is pretty bad for the moment, so a meeting between the two Koreas seems even less likely.",

        "Exchange rate currently 36.96 RUB to a USD. Was around 32 at the start of 2014, with particularly steep decline in value of RUB during unrest in Crimea and initial announcement of sanctions.\n \n As unrest in eastern Ukraine linked with Russia intensifies, it appears that further sanctions are likely: it would be reasonable to expect these to lead to a further decline in value of the RUB: the exchange rate has already reached 37.49 on recent occasion (http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&to=RUB&view=1Y) : it would not take a great deal for it to reach more than 38.00\n \n One forecast mentioned at http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/ruble-is-the-latest-casualty-in-ukraine-crisis/506459.html refers to the likelihood of increased exchange rate volatility vis a vis the USD. While this agency has revised its year-end forecast of the RUB-USD exchange rate to 37.5 , it also envisages that further sanctions will lead to an exchange rate in excess of 38 - while crude prices will also be a factor for Russia's energy-dominated economy.\n \n Clearly an area to keep an eye on, but at present this event appears to be rather more likely than not\n ",
        "At present, seems unlikely (not least owing to failure to have attained substantive and enduring control over a coherent or recognized territorial unit - e.g. either of the oblasts of Donetsk or Luhansk in anything like their entirety), but  not inconceivable.\n \n However, the annexation of Crimea, effectively an unprecedented event in post-WWII European history (as a unilateral transfer of territory from one state to another) - as distinct from the formation of de facto but not de iure territories reliant on another state during wartime (as in Croatia and Bosnia, or Nagornyi Karabakh).\n \n Principal arguments that might support such an action seem to include:\n \n a) dismissal in August of senior officials in both the \"People's Republics\" declared in Luhansk and Donestk, indicating the onset of a new approach to the management of these regions beyond the control of the Ukrainian state\n \n b)  Increasing talk of \"Novorossiya\" (which term would generally be considered to, eventually, encompass a substantially larger area than that currently lost to Ukraine: and stretching to Odessa - near Russian troops based in Transnistria, Moldova - in the SW and to Kharkhiv in the NE); and, in particular, a recent speech in which Pres. Putin spoke of the desirability of \"statehood\" being granted to it.\n \n c) The recent Russian military surge.\n \n d) (unconfirmed) reports of Russian passports being distributed to residents of some of the territories outside Ukrainian control - - as had previously occurred in Crimea, and also in South Ossetia and Abkhazia prior to Russian military action in 2008.\n \n Parliamentary elections in Moldova on 30 November might be a catalyst for some kind of action (e.g. in the Odessa region), should a more solid and coherent pro-Western coalition than that existing at present win there. \n \n The impact of winter and energy issues may also be a factor. Provision of heat and light from Ukraine to eg Donetsk, but not elsewhere in Ukraine may strengthen Russia's hand in the event that some annexation is declared.\n ",

        "Cy inion polls appear to universally agree that no candidate will get at least 50pc in the first round to avert a run-off.  \n \n Although I've no data immediately to hand to back up this assertion, this state of affairs also appears to be a commonplace occurrence - almost the norm - in other countries that have a multiparty (rather than, like the US, an essentially two-party)  system, genuinely competitive elections, and direct presidential elections (to a powerful/executive presidency) in which an overall majority of votes cast is required to claim victory. (Numerous countries in Europe - both West e.g. France and East e.g. Ukraine - and in West Africa - e.g. Mali have demonstrated this in recent years)",
        "The few weeks of stability following the February 20th agreement seem to be over as Greece has repeatedly failed to provide economic plans that satisfy the Eurogroup. Outflows from the banking system have resumed (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-26/greek-bank-deposits-plunge-to-10-year-low-as-eu-patience-frays) and the stock market has resumed its slide to levels below half what it was 12 months ago. The government is rumoured to have struggled to make payroll and pension contributions this month and faces \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2.4bn of debt to rollover or repay in April (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-26/here-are-the-most-important-dates-ahead-in-the-greek-crisis). Largely frozen out of international bond markets it clearly needs more bailout funds in the short-term or it needs to default and leave the Euro. Given the latter outcome is unpalatable for all concerned a compromise will almost certainly be reached and indications are that Greece is edging towards its \"sweet spot\" of appearing to make minimal concessions to its electorate whilst making enough to satisfy its creditors (http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/news/2015/03/greeks-to-submit-revised-austerity-plan-to-secure-bailout-extension/).\n \n It's a slow and politically volatile process though; reports that Greece may run out of cash before the end of April are probably overstated and it can be kept on life-support a bit longer through the ELA program without releasing more bailout funds. That a compromise will be reached seems near certain. That this will be resolved before the end of the question period seems most likely given that the increasing costs of the uncertainty around this, but the possibility of this situation limping on into May is far from negligible.",
        "Fastest recent parallel I can find is the Eurasian Development Bank, which involved only 2 countries initially, and took 11 months from being signed into existence to announcing its first loan.\n \n NDB will not have its first tranche of $750m until January 2015 and there's much work to be done to make it operational. The Russian finance minister, immediately prior to the official announcement, had said he expected the bank to be able to start lending in 2016. A South African press report this week commented (though without reference) \"The [..] (Brics) plans to launch its New Development Bank (NDB) within 18 to 24 months.\" This timetable seems more realistic.\n \n It would surely be desirable to announce a first loan commitment at the 7th BRICS summit in July 2015. An announcement earlier than this seems very unlikely.",
        "From 51.8 a fall to under 50.0 is well within the service PMI short-term variability so such an event is certainly a possibility.  Manufacturing PMI, more exposed to the global economy as China's services exports aren't high, has been hovering a couple of points either side of 50.0 for the last three years and is currently 49.7. This suggests PMI is not a measure that in itself would prompt defensive action in China's command economy.\n \n Looking at the constituents; I see negatives around input prices (low commodity prices have more of an indirect impact on services but lower general inflation will) and prices charged (again due to low inflation). Expectations and business activity I see as broadly neutral - negatives around the slowing economy will probably be offset by government action to boost the services sector (http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/14/uk-china-exports-idUKKBN0LI0H720150214) and services are more domestically focussed so less directly impact by cooling exports. Rising employment in the short term is probably broadly neutral against outstanding work. Overall I see more weight on the negative side but not strongly so.\n \n There are constraints around the government's ability to inject stimulus into the domestic economy (http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-drop-in-inflation-pressures-central-bank-to-expand-credit-1423580379) but it still has room to move and services are seen as a strategic focus in the mid-term. Whilst a fall below 50 is in range of short term variability, the longer-term trend in recent years has stayed above this level and I see a good chance of it remaining so in the near future. \n \n The timing of the Chinese New Year in February this year makes March's figure harder to predict; if it holds above 50 I'm likely to increase my confidence around this for the remaining two months.",
        "Russia agreed to sell the S-300 in 2007 then cancelled in 2010, sparking a lawsuit which had not been resolved by the start of this year when Russia and Iran signed an agreement on greater military co-operation (http://rt.com/news/224443-russia-iran-defense-deal/). Russia reportedly offered the Antey-2500 system in 2013 but was rebuffed (http://missilethreat.com/putin-to-offer-advanced-antimissiles-to-soothe-irans-s-300-grudge-report/, http://en.trend.az/iran/2220525.html)\n \n A deal would appeal to Russia on a number of levels, strengthening ties to countries not aligned to the sanctions against it, generating arms export revenue, putting the original S-300 lawsuit to rest and satisfying Iran's need for weapons systems it is trying to develop a domestic capability to build.\n \n Whether a move to purchase this system would help or hinder Iran's negotiations with the P5+1 is hard to predict; however an announcement before the current talks deadline would seem unlikely. Failure of the current talks would certainly seem to make one more likely. \n \n Timeframe is the key here with regard to the question period - decisions of this sort can take months (there were 5 between the 2013 offer and its rejection). With a visit to Tehran by Putin expected April/May though (http://www.newsweek.com/putin-visit-iran-soon-says-tehran-311319) I'm leaning towards a sale being agreed right now.

But I still believe we will see another attack (perhaps not as flashy) in the next couple of months in one of the listed countries.  \n \n ",

The epidemic is rampant in West Africa and travel to and from the EU has not been curtailed.  The incubation period (8-10 days, up to 21 days) is long enough to travel to another country without symptoms and then manifest Ebola later.  \n \n In addition to the likelihood that Ebola makes it to an EU member state through \"chance,\" I am forecasting high on this question because the disparity in health care between West Africa and an EU member state like the UK is so high that it creates the incentive to engage in Trojan Horse-like behavior.  \n \n If a person with enough means to purchase air travel knows they have been exposed to Ebola in West Africa, their best shot at survival is to book a flight asap to a country that will be able to provide the supportive care that brings the 90% fatality rate down to 50-60%.  This reality was highlighted recently when medical personnel in Liberia were transported to the US to receive care that resulted in their survival.  For these reasons, I am forecasting high--any difference between my forecast and 100% is due to my uncertainty regarding timing (i.e. before the close of this question at the end of May, 2015) rather than the certainty of the event ever happening.",

        "Jonathan has indicated he wants to run again in the February presidential elections, so the question slants heavily to whether he and his PDP party can capture the election.

The two men vying to oppose him sound like they have little to offer, other than long track records of accomplishing little. A split along religious lines doesn't help analysis much : country has slightly more Muslim followers than Christian, however that's likely more than compensated by the prospects of getting any kind of voter turnout in the regions undergoing Boko Haram terror.\n \n So unless Jonathan changes his mind about running (possible), or some large outrage occurs to turn people against Jonathan ( an outrage likely, but if the recent inability to combat outrageous terrorism hasn't sufficiently angered the public, it's difficult to imagine what would), then Jonathan could remain in the Presidency through June 10, 2015.",
        "This question is much along the same lines as voided question # 1422, just a bit more specific in that it specifies certain countries. I reviewed maps showing current ISIS-controlled areas, I quickly skimmed some Gulf State news websites, which don't appear particularly worried about attacks in their own countries ( likely because media is heavily influenced by the governments). Not really going to use any of that info in this assessment. \n \n I see three possibilities for ISIS over the midterm. The two extremes , where ISIS continues its momentum or where ISIS starts getting aggressively defeated, yield for me the same result on this question: a very significant probability of attack on one or more of the named countries. ( In first case because of power, in second case because of desperation.)\n The third possibility is that ISIS and its opponents get drawn into a prolonged conflict in Syria and Iraq where neither side has the upper hand. Here I would expect ISIS to consolidate its efforts somewhat and focus on the base conflict. In this case it would likely be a wildcard attack on another country, but not \"coordinated\" by ISIS leadership. So I see the probability here to be somewhat less, but still significant.\n \n Which in balance leaves me suggesting a 70% probability of ISIS attacking one of the specified countries in the next four months.",

        "The only recent official visit I could find a reference to was the visit of Putin to Tehran in 2007.  The base rate of official visits is thus very low - around 5-10%.  However, Iran has been more open to engaging with the rest of the world recently, so this is probably an underestimate.\n According to Iranian sources, Putin indicated this January that \"I hope to visit you in Tehran very soon.\" ([1]).  This source is not entirely credible, and there were previous reports of visits in July and September 2013 that have not taken place (see [2] for one of the better reports).  Still, I think Putin has a fair (20%) chance of visiting Iran in the period.\n There have also been not entirely credible reports that Xi Jinping will visit in 2015 (see [3]).  I will assign this a 15% probability.\n Of the G7 leaders, the most likely one to visit Tehran is probably Obama.  According to a recent article however, such a visit is a \"long shot\" ([4]).  I think this is about a 10% chance over the time period of the question.  I will also assign a 5% chance to another G7 leader visiting Tehran.\n Adding up my probabilities, and subtracting 10% to take into account visits by multiple leaders, I get a 40% estimate of a \"head of state\" (actually some of the leaders listed are only heads of government) visiting in the time period.\n The biggest wildcard here is the Iranian nuclear negotiations.

Given this, it would be reasonable to expect there to be substantially more than the current 6,405 confirmed cases before the outbreak ends.\n What is required for this question to resolve is to have an asymptomatic individual with Ebola go from one of the West African nations where it is prevalent to a EU member state.  Given that the incubation period is 8 days, this is quite possible.  Having said that, it has not happened yet (or at least is not known about yet).  However, with the exponential growth in cases, as well as the spread of Ebola to Nigeria, there will be a lot more opportunities for it to happen.  One (confirmed) case would be sufficient to resolve the question as \"yes\".\n \n For comparison, the SARS outbreak (with a similar number of cases) did involve a small number of cases in Europe.

His declarations are seen as provocations, but he is likely to be acting more moderate vis-a-vis the more extremist forces in the Kremlin (DOMESTIC POLITICS CONSTRAINTS) and the Western forces that are encroaching into Russia's sphere of influence. He recently claimed to not want to annex Ukrainian territory but rather push for a political solution that would grant greater autonomy to the Eastern regions in Ukraine.",
        "Public opinion trends on the issue of Scottish independence have not changed significantly in the past 15 years: no majority has supported independence from the UK. \n \n In the 2013 Scottish Social Attitudes survey (SSA), for example, only 29% of those polled believed that Scotland should become independent from the UK, compared with 55% who believe Scotland should remain part of the UK. The average support for YES between 1999 and 2013 is 28%.\n \n In the past months, though, the YES side has gained some momentum. More recent polls seem to signal greater support to YES. According to a poll by pollster Survation, support for YES is at 47%, while that of NO at 53%. The second and last televised debate on 25 August between the YES and NO campaign leaders might have had an effect on voter preference. Only three weeks earlier Survation's survey showed the YES vote at 43% and the NO vote at 57%. \n \n The final two weeks might see an uptick for YES support, but likely not enough to overcome the NO, so I'm putting my estimate at a low position. \n ",
        "IS has successful taken over considerable swathes of territory across Syria and Iraq, and that operational action of taking over territory is part of it's the main part of their overall strategy to create an Islamic state. However, it will not attempt the same in the short with other countries such as Jordan, even less the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE that are farther away from their strongholds. This is because their operational capabilities are not that significant, and have also suffered strains from the US-led campaign against it in Iraq and Syria. So for the moment, the only thing they could do to \"punish\" those \"infidel\" states is to plan terrorist attacks inside those countries. This is relatively cheaper to do and easier to carry out, and would be more likely to occur in the next months.\n \n For that, I'm giving a high estimate of 75% and will adjust depending on new developments. \n \n * Comparison classes inform probability estimates (POMP)\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Expansion from Syria to Iraq: IS quickly expanded in eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq, however that expansion was mainly due to weak governance in those two countries; conquering land in Jordan and the other countries that support the US-led campaign is much more challenging, and will not be attempted right now. In fact, IS is trying to take over more cities in Syria (e.g. Kobane) and Iraq, and consolidate their holdings. \n \n * Hunt for the right information.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 What are IS' intention?\n i. Expansion up to what point?\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Do they have the capabilities to carry out attacks on those countries?\n i. IS mostly works by militarily taking over territory so that may not be viable if US-led air strikes continue and increase, as IS seems more focused on holding the territory it's won so far in Iraq and along the Iraqi-Syrian border\n \n * Know the power players, their goals, and motivation to prevail on an issue\n a. IS: main intention is to create an Islamic state; it focused on Syria and Iraq but has vowed to expand beyond to Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine; its capabilities do not seem large enough to conquer those territories, like it's done in Syria and Iraq, but it can still engage in attacks. \n b. Bahrain: has participated in air strikes against IS in Syria; hosts American bases\n c. Qatar: Believed to have finance terrorism; hosts American bases in its territory; might be targeted if IS see's Bahrain's actions as a major act of betrayal (speculation); \n d. Jordan: most outspoken on their support; participated in airstrikes; will commit ground forces; provides intelligence\n e. UAE: launched airstrikes in Syria\n f. Saudi Arabia: Has been threatened by IS, which blames the Saudis for letting Western attacks; its hosting US training of Syrian opposition, so that could be perceived as a major act of betrayal (similar to AQ's reasoning to target the US, its bases on Arab lands following first gulf war)\n i. Train and equip Syrian opposition forces to fight IS in Syria; $500 in humanitarian aid\n g. Turkey: allowed foreign troops to launch attacks from Turkey; authorized to use military force against IS \n h. Kurds in Iraq: fiercely fighting IS in Iraq and across the border in Syria; willing to commit more forces to fight IS beyond Kurdish territory if done within a broad international coalition and strategy\n i. US & NATO: have led the attack on IS strongholds, but made sure other countries joined, especially those in the regional with more to lose. That coalition might put those countries on IS' radar, consider them traitors and infidels, and therefore push for actions against those countries (if not outright invasion, terrorist attacks)\n ",
        "The debate surrounding the plunge in oil prices centers on changes in the international context. Factors driving down prices include a boost in US shale gas production, recovery in oil production in other OPEC and non-OPEC countries (e.g. Libya following its civil war), and even continuing supply by major oil players like Saudi Arabia. This price decline has created inner rifts among OPEC countries, as those who depend most on high oil prices for sustaining its budget want OPEC to agree a major cut in production to boost prices. On the other side are the large producers, which can withstand oil prices at around $80 or even less. These are calling for patience, arguing that the prices might resurge as demand spikes in the following winter months. By 16 October oil prices had already slightly recovered, which might help ease worries. These countries also prefer to maintain their market share than to cut production with the aim of boosting prices. So given the influence of Saudi Arabia (1/3 of OPEC's output) and the other Gulf countries, a decision in the next meeting will likely tilt towards keeping production as it is. \n \n Aside from that, OPEC members will meet on 27 November to debate and decide whether to cut production amid the recent plunge in oil prices, not to make an actual cut in production. So I strongly doubt a cut would be put in place by that date. I will start with a low estimate of 10% chance that a cut in production happens at 27 November or before.\n ",

However, Iran is also reported to have said they will not ask for OPEC to reduce output. The wildcard is Venezuela which has called for an emergency meeting of OPEC ahead of Nov 27. No indication this will happen though.\n \n Recent news reporting is explicit that OPEC nations say they will not reduce output in the near future. Further, the price drop, which is in part due to increased production in the US of shale gas, could make additional shale development too expensive to continue, thereby reducing output and bringing prices back up. This is based on my understanding that shale drilling is more expensive than the typical form of oil extraction, and that output from shale wells drops off precipitously after an initial high output, requiring new wells to be drilled regularly to maintain overall output levels.\n \n My initial forecast will favor output not being cut and I will adjust over time as the deadline approaches, while also monitoring benchmark oil prices.",

Iran needs oil prices to stay high in order to profit, but if sanctions are lifted in exchange for an agreement to reduce Iranian nuclear capacity, they would likely want to ramp up production for export to new markets. Kuwait has also stated that they may not want to cut production, as they can handle a lower price and want to keep their market share high.

        "The simple answer is No, with a small, but not insignificant majority in favor of No camp (i.e. remaining part of the UK).\n \n There are a lot of uncertainties that the Yes (Independence) camp have not managed to overcome in certain demographics of the Scotish vote. \n \n One of the biggest uncertainties is just how much control Scotland, as a smaller nation, would have over its own economic and financial destiny after independence. For example, Alex Salmond, has promised he will keep the pound, however most people know that that is not the issue. Scotland or any counrty for that matter can keep or adopt the pound as its currency. The issue would be what control would Scotland have over its economy and currency if all the decisions about the pound are made in Westminster. Scotland would have no leverage and what is left of the British government/nation would have no motivation to make life easy for the new Scotish government nor would Scotland be part of their priorities when deciding economic matters.\n \n It is no secrete that the UK and the EU have differing economic and political views. Scotland, or at least the SNP wishes to be closer to the EU but if an independent Scotland adopts the pound they would be economically linked (or limited) by UK economic policies but eventually politically linked (or limited) by EU politics. \n \n The other option would be to adopt the Euro. The Yes camp has not opted to go for the Euro as its currency because they know they would have even less control as very small country in the EU. The question that leads from there is, what is the point of independence if you have no real control over your currency or economy? It becomes independence in name but not in practice.\n \n The desire for independence is more emotional than realistic and there is probably a slightly greater majority who do not wish to risk the uncertainty post independence for short term emotional satisfaction.  \n \n ",

Now that the Euro Zone is also weak the average Greek would be wondering why they have stick to a plan that is not working for either them or the people/countries who are forcing them to to do so.\n \n Consequently people in Greece are more open to alternative ideas from parties like Syriza. From their perspective, what have they to lose?\n \n Their choices are to take a long, painful economic road, carrying a painful debt burden with no guarantee that they will achieve a standard of living they enjoyed in their lifetime or vote Syriza and take a short and painful road through debt default and start afresh with a new (old) Greek currency that they control. The pain would look easier to bear if they feel in control. Right now Greeks do not feel like they are in control of their destiny.\n \n Having said all of that, Greece has been in the Euro form the beginning and there is a sizable portion of the population who see more benefits with sticking with the big Euro fish in the big pond rather than being the small fish in the pond.\n \n My prediction is that Syriza will have a but workable slim majority.\n \n http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/08/why-greeces-economy-needs-syriza-to-win-election/\n \n http://www.theweek.co.uk/europe/62004/syriza-the-radical-greek-left-wingers-poised-to-take-power\n \n http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/07/us-greece-election-polls-idUSKBN0KG1OP20150107\n \n http://www.novinite.com/articles/165846/SYRIZA+Leads+Opinion+Polls+Ahead+of+Greek+Elections",

The September 2013 minimum was 5.4 million sq/km, while the record low minimum set in 2012 was just over 3.6 million sq/km.\"\n \n All right. This is based on different data, apparently, but I'm going to run with it for now.\n \n Then there is [4]. Haven't looked at it yet.\n \n [1] http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2014/08/asi-2014-update-7-late-momentum.html\n [2] http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/\n [3] http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/climatechange/arctic-sea-ice-update-and-exte/30194006\n [4] http://www.arcus.org/sipn",
        "\"Germany and France in 2008 blocked a decision to give Ukraine and Georgia a so-called Membership Action Plan, a first step to joining Nato, despite US pressure to go ahead.\" [1]\n \n Will things be different this time around? I doubt it. What about an offer to some other country? Maybe.\n \n Then there is the already-linked BBC article, which mentions a bill in the Ukrainian parliament relating to NATO membership. But this might not pass, and even if it does, it would only start the process. Membership would require an actual offer from NATO too, of course.\n \n I will want to take a closer look at statements from the NATO secretary-general and others to the effect that they would still welcome Ukraine as a NATO member. Can such statements be taken seriously, especially now that Russia has sullied Ukrainian territory with the annexation of Crimea and quasi-occupation of the eastern regions? For now, I'm going to say no.\n \n [1] http://euobserver.com/defence/125399",

        "Looks like the last time it was that high was earlier this year (Ukraine/Russia-related stuff?). It has also gone _really_ high in the past, like in late 2011 (Greek stuff? banking crisis? gotta check that). The way I'm thinking about this is 'Will there be any semi-major disruption to the European economy within this timeframe?' because that seems to be what's correlated with a >23 VSTOXX. Will need to look into it further though. The base rate for >=23 is at least a few times in the last couple years... and a lot prior to that, like consistently >23 for long periods. Hmm. I suspect that the most likely to push it above 23 again before May will be economic sanctions from/against Russia, especially if there is a disruption in Russia's energy supply to Europe as a result. And there is much room for something unexpected happening - another financial crisis in some random European country, that sort of thing.",

The institute also noted that there are signs that the North may be preparing the site for high-level visits in anticipation of a test.\n \n Besides seeing the viability of the missiles, North Korea has other motivations to test - they will need to up the ante to get the attention of the U.S. and other actors to try to get some concessions (esp. with all of the other hotspots and problems in the world, they need to do something big to get attention).

        "As many analysts have pointed out, a no-fly zone (NFZ) would require either 1) cooperation from the Assad regime or 2) destruction of Syria's air defenses. The following military, economic, and political factors weigh heavily against either event occurring.\n \n Military factors: 1. A NFZ would require hundreds of US aircraft and a significant amount of personnel; 2. There's no indication a NFZ would alter the campaign against ISIS (the stated US goal); 3. A NFZ could be an open-ended, lengthy endeavor (e.g., NFZ in Iraq from 1991-2003); and, 4. Syria possesses formidable, Russian-acquired air defenses (overlapping SAMs and anti-aircraft guns), not easily destroyed.\n \n Economic factors: 1. Estimated US military costs for a Syrian NFZ are ~$1 billion/month.\n \n Political factors: 1. The US would have to stage equipment/personnel nearby for rescuing any downed pilots, thereby broadening the mission beyond President Obama's pledges; 2. Absent a UNSC or other international mandate (as in Libya, Iraq, Bosnia), the legal basis for a NFZ in Syria is lacking; there is no UN mandate for a NFZ and Russia has voiced its opposition to any NFZ in Syria; 3. President Obama has ruled out cooperation with Assad due to the regime's alleged human rights violations, and allies such as Turkey would oppose any deal that strengthened the Assad regime; and 4. The Syrian Foreign Ministry has voiced official opposition to any NFZ, citing sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n \n I've predicted 15% for this IFP in the unlikely events that the NFZ proponents gain support, coalition partners impose a NFZ unilaterally and/or uncertain events on the battlefield alter the situation. \n \n (www.news.yahoo.com/despite-demands-syria-no-fly-zone-no-us-094120500-politics.html; www.rferl.org/content/syria-russia-oppose-turkey-buffer-zone/26639112.html; www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R41701.pdf)",

        "Since Barzani announced the KRG's intent in early July to hold an independence referendum, key events have occurred which significantly lower the likelihood that such a referendum will be held. In early August, the US (a strong and vocal opponent of Kurdish independence) began providing military assistance to the Kurds in their fight against ISIS; other KRG allies who oppose independence have also supplied military assistance.  On 8/12/14, al-Maliki lost his bid for another term, creating the possibility for future political compromise in Baghdad, and KRG ministers have since rejoined the administration. The KRG has also experienced legal and political setbacks in its attempts to market and transport independent Kurdish oil shipments.\n On 8/12/14, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari confirmed in an interview with the Washington Post that \"priorities have changed\" and the independence referendum has been \"put aside\" so that the KRG can focus on defeating ISIS and forming a new government in Baghdad (washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/lally-weymouth-interviews-former-iraqi-foreign-minister-hoshyar-zebari/2014/08/12/98f4a838-2257-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html). \n If the independent election commission previously approved by the KRG parliament moves foward with establishing protocols and a timeline for a referendum, I will adjust my prediction accordingly.",

        "Rationale 1:  There are tremendous liquidity problems in the real economy due to the European Commission, Central Bank and IMF refusing to play ball with the new government.  The key issue is that all the funds that went to the bank re-capitalization are now at risk given the slow but clear draining of bank deposits.  This is the second time in 3 years that they see this happening.  Every time it happens it costs a lot of money to save the banks and in the real economy setting everything back by months if not years.  So, self preservation by Greece leads to a YES along with EU's recognition that they are likely to waste more money if they don't spend it now. \n \n Rationale 2:  There is tremendous pressure within SYRIZA.  The \"left wing\" rationale has been reflected in the writings of John Milios and Dimitri Sotiropoulos.  It influenced SYRIZA's approach to date.  However, I have heard that John Milios has resigned.  So, the shift closer to the EU/IMG/ECBank demands will be swift. \n \n Rationale 3:  Tsipras is meeting with EU/GER/FRA/ECB heads today.

In recent months, it appears they have been content with the lower prices to put stress on the frackers.  Limiting production now would mean an abandonment of this effort.

China invited all members of the Asian Development Bank to join the AIIB.\n \n Wagner noted: \"Given that all international financial institutions are at their core political entities, disguised as development banks...In order to be successful as a political institution, the AIIB will first need to be successful as a development institution... If China will publicly stress the importance of good governance as an essential component of making the development process work, the AIIB has a chance of being successful, and may work well in generating significantly more financial resources for the region. If not, the AIIB could become an embarrassment for China's government, and, in the end, its own commercial interests. With Xi Jinping's personal endorsement and credibility on the line, there is a better chance that it will succeed, than not. The proof will be in the pudding.\" \n \n We have to ask what the political drivers for the NDB. China provides leadership for the AIIB. China, based solely on the numbers, is also the NDB leader: \"This fund will consist of $10 billion of \"paid-in capital\" ($2 billion from each member to be provided over seven years) and an additional $40 billion to be \"paid upon request\". Out of the total initial capital of $100 billion, China will contribute $41 billion, Brazil, Russia and India would give $18 billion each, and South Africa would contribute $5 billion.\" ~~ based on the treaty establishing the NDB.\n \n \"It is scheduled to start lending in 2016.\" ~~Russian Finance Minister\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n Based on these and other reports, it is highly unlikely the NDB will be funded, that administration will be in place, and that the NDB will be ready to lend by July 2015. At this point, the NDB -- and the AIIB -- are up the flagpole waiting for a salute.",

Thus, pressure from EU is off the table in that sense BUT the pipeline will run through Europe (over which EU will have a say) if the big plan is a pipe from Russia to Europe.\n \n The construction of the Serbian stretch of the pipeline is due to start in October, the head of Gazprom's international projects department Alexander Siromyatin said on Tuesday.\n \n According to Wikileaks: Moscow is using Romania to put pressure on neighbouring Bulgaria as part of an energy game being played between Russia's South Stream pipeline project and its EU rival Nabucco. \n Romania seems to have no objections to this scheme and is clearly convinced that it will be able to choose which project it wants to participate in at the end. \n \n The rival ventures have planned to construct pipelines to transfer natural gas to Europe; from Russia in the case of South Stream; from the Middle East and across Turkey in the case of Nabucco. Both projects are supposed to start delivering gas in 2015, but neither pipeline has been built yet and the exact transit routes are still unclear. \n \n Bulgaria depends entirely on Russian deliveries (WikiLeaks).

(Leaks) Also: The South Stream gas pipeline, designed to transport 31 billion cubic metres of natural gas annually, will begin from Russia and, through the Black Sea, it will get to Bulgaria, where it will divide into two branches: one towards Greece and Italy and the second towards Serbia, Hungary and Austria.\n \n Consdering this pipeline is to be completed in 2015 and operational in 2018, seems likely to resume work.\n ",

This could depend on Russia's behavior and the West's trust of Putin. Given the short time frame, I cannot imagine this getting back on track before January:\n \n \"There is now potential for huge delays. Sceptics wonder whether it will happen at all.\"\n \n \"The European Commission is insisting that other gas suppliers be given access to South Stream. It says the idea of Gazprom both providing the gas and owning the pipeline through which it flows contravenes the EU's \"third energy package\" - and, these days, Brussels is in no mood to grant Gazprom an exemption.\n \n Attempts to reach a solution have failed. The commission recently suspended talks aimed at bringing South Stream into line with EU laws. It has forced Bulgaria to freeze construction work on its section of the pipeline and is also investigating whether Sofia breached EU competition rules in the way it awarded South Stream-related contracts. \n \n But delays seem inevitable. Brussels-watchers say negotiations over a third-party waiver - allowing Gazprom to operate the pipeline exclusively - could take years, despite heavy lobbying by companies with stakes in the project, such as Eni. \n Still, Bulgaria's energy minister, Dragomir Stoynev, said he believed the project would eventually move forward.\n \n \"If we look at the situation strategically and without emotions, the South Stream project looks irreversible and important for both Europe and Bulgaria,\" Mr Stoynev told Bulgarian state radio. \"I am convinced that all pending issues will find a solution.\" \n \n \"A lot of the country's political and business interests are reliant on South Stream going ahead, so the government is looking very fragile over the issue.\"",
        "On July 3, Masoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, asked the Kurdish parliament to form an independent commission to start organizing a referendum on independence. \n Since then, however, ISIL attacked the Kurds and Nouri al-Maliki was ousted in favor of a leader who appears to be far less partisian (pro-Shia) and the US conducted airstrikes.  \n U.S. officials stated this week that the direct aid delivered via the CIA will be expanded in the future only in coordination with Baghdad. Further, the U.S. is still advocating Iraq's integrity.\n \n \"The Kurds' top priority is now to defeat ISIL and secure their existence. Hence their independence project will be in cold storage for a while.\"\n \n In addition, today Arbil needs Baghdad and the regional powers as never before. Barzani's chief of staff, Fuad Hussein, who I had interviewed one month ago, made this claim. He said they need to cooperate with Baghdad, Turkey and Iran in their fight against ISIL and hence would not take any step without their consent. It is more than obvious that under the current circumstances, Turkey and Iran would not give them the green light to independence.\n \n Moreover, Arbil could not do anything \"despite the U.S.\" If it wants to be independent, it first needs international recognition which means: American recognition.\n Further, Iran does not want independence neither does Turkey. \n Thus, though the Kurds want it, I think January 2015 is not likely because of these latest developments. \n \n \n ",

Joseph Dunford - the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan -remains optimistic, believing the election stalemate will be settled, the security agreement signed and the effort to advise and equip the Afghan forces will continue.\n \n Karzai, who has been trying to bring both sides together to overcome the impasse, met with the two candidates Sunday and again Tuesday after Abdullah's boycott threat. Karzai has said that the inauguration of the new president must happen by Sept. 2. That is just two days before NATO members are expected to meet in Wales.\n \n Major Challenge:\n \n There is not currently a president to sign it and there is a major power struggle. \n \n Further, Abdullah Abdullah, pulled his observers Wednesday from an audit of the country's disputed election over concerns of widespread fraud in a move that throws the already contentious election into further crisis.\n \n The U.S. brokered the audit of the eight million ballots from the country's June presidential runoff as a way to end what had been a debilitating impasse over who would take over from outgoing President Hamid Karzai. But the audit, which was announced in July, has proceeded in fits and starts as both sides have argued strenuously over every ballot.\n \n The U.N. has been helping supervise the audit along with Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission.\n \n The campaign's decision to drop its support for the ballot raises concerns about whether Abdullah's team and those who voted for him would consider any resulting government to be valid. That could have dangerous repercussions in a country still struggling to overcome ethnic and religious divides and battling a resurgent Taliban insurgency.\n \n In my opinion, a president will be declared.

Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and UKIP leader Nigel Farage wrote to the prime minister last week, saying it would be \"unacceptable\" for him not to appear. David Cameron ruled out getting involved under the current format, which includes Nigel Farage but not Green Party leader Natalie Bennett. The pre-general election debate was firstly introduced in 2010. Recent polls show a huge public appetite for its continuation.\n \n Major parties worry that positive exposure for minority parties could undermine their voter base. These anxieties are not groundless, as UK politics have seen a shift away from a two party system in recent years. The two big parties together are struggling to get 65 percent of the total vote now, while 60 years ago they got 98 percent. \n \n Despite the unpredictability of the upcoming election, Sean Kippin believes it is likely that the 2015 general election will see another \"hung parliament,\" with the Conservatives losing seats and Labour winning them. Whether the shift will put Labour in power remains to be seen. \n \n Tony Travers, director of a research center at the London School of Economics and Professor in the LSE's Government Department, examined the parties' prospects by analyzing historical data from local elections. \n \n \"The 2015 general election will be determined by the impact of the vote shares of a series of 'minor' parties on the two big ones,\" Travers said, adding that it is likely the Conservative plus Labour vote share in May will be similar to or below 2010 levels.  \n \n The latest YouGov poll on January 20 shows a tight race, with Conservatives at 32 percent of the vote, Labour at 30 percent, Liberal-Democratic 8 percent, UKIP 15 percent, and the Green Party at 10 percent.\n \n Kippin believed that it is possible to envisage any one of three or four scenarios: a majority Labour government, a minority Labour government (a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition, a Labour-SNP coalition), a second term of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, or a more informal pact featuring smaller parties such as UKIP (who despite high opinion poll ratings will find it difficult to translate this popularity into seats thanks to the UK's first-past-the-post electoral system), the Greens, Plaid Cymru, and the Democratic Unionist Party.\n http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/903263.shtml",

(but the biggest trade headline was a breakthrough in negotiations with China to eliminate tariffs on information technology products..expanding the Information Technology Agreement would create up to 60,000 jobs in the United States by eliminating tariffs on goods that generate $1 trillion in sales a year.)\n \n The United States and China are still fierce rivals for global economic primacy, promoting competing free-trade blocs for the Asian region. Mr. Obama credited APEC with originating the work on reducing tariffs,\n \n A 12-country free-trade accord known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).. Obama says the trade zone encompassing some 40% of global production will benefit the US. (protectionist labor unions are opposed)\n \n Mr. Obama could explain his plans to secure so-called trade promotion authority from Congress. Such \"fast-track\" authority would force U.S. lawmakers to vote yes-or-no on a final TPP accord without the ability to force amendments.\n Mr. Obama has an opportunity to demonstrate some political and policy goodwill by calling for passage of fast-track authority within the first 100 days of the next Congress.\n  Republicans have become the freer-trade American party, and Mr. Obama should quickly seize the bipartisan political opportunity.\n \n  On the other hand the administration faces a longer path on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, \n Japanese farmers are opposed to competition. The Abe government appears to appreciate the need for a deal, as tariffs of up to 778% on imported rice and 328% on sugar force Japanese to spend 14% of their discretionary income on food, compared with 7% for Americans.\n The two largest TPP participants - the U.S. and Japan are not even close in their dialogue.\n \n What does \"Will negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) be completed \" mean anyway?\n \n \n http://online.wsj.com/articles/a-fresh-start-for-pacific-trade-1415577301\n http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/11/11/john-ivison-any-significant-progress-made-on-the-trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-is-pure-bureaucratic-bs/",

        "The last missile launch by North Korea http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/26/world/asia/north-korea-rodong-missile-launch/\n \n was of the Rodong (aka Nodong) a \"medium-range ballistic missile\".  According to (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_North_Korean_missile_tests), the Rodong is based on Scud, a Russian tactical ballistic missle.  The estimated range is 1000km.  This is well short of the 5700km to Alaska, 7500km to Hawaii, or 9550km to Los Angeles that would be necessary to meet the forecast definition of \"long-range missile\".\n \n http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/04/14/the-ultimate-north-korean-missile-threat-to-america-a-nuke-power-grid-attack/\n \n describes a \"medium range Musudan\" missiles underdevelopment with estimated range of 2500km, still below the distance required to reach continental US, Alaska or Hawaii.\n \n Finally, in Dec 2012 North Korea launched the Unha-3 rocket and apparently place a (dead) satellite into orbit. This rocket could reach the US as stated:  http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/world/asia/north-korean-rocket-had-military-purpose-seoul-says.html?_r=0 \"ballistic missile that could fly more than 6,200 miles, with a warhead of about 1,100 to 1,300 pounds, putting the West Coast of the United States in range.\"  Although some conflicting sites list the range as 4160 miles, that still brings Hawaii and Alaska into range.\n \n So while North Korea apparently has demonstrated the technology for a long-range missile, they haven't utilized one since Dec. of 2012, instead using shorter range missiles as a means of sending a message to the world. So a combination of the difficulty in launching a long range missile, combined with the ability to meet the short term goals of \"messaging\" with short and medium term missiles, leads one to believe the logical step would be for N Korea to continue with the recent pattern.  Therefore I would estimate a low probability of a positive outcome for this question.\n \n However, North Korea (and Kim Jong Un) is notoriously unpredictable in both leadership changes, nuclear program developments, and military actions.  Arguably, a perceived provocation, such as South Korea's use of THAAD missile defense would increase the probability of a more meaningful missile test.  As a pure dictorship, Kim Jong-Un alone can make the decision, making evaluation of potential outcomes risky, as his tenure has been market by multiple aggressive military actions.  For that reason I raised the outcomes under b) from 10% to 20% to account for this wildcard action.\n ",
        "Unlikely.  It appears that each country needs to approve the NDB charter (section 48) before it can commence operation.  It took two years from the decision to form the bank (4th BRiC summit) to the signing of this announcement.  A lot would need  to happen in 9 months: each country's approval, transfer of $10 bn working capital, higher staff, solicited project loan requests, loan selection.  Etc.  \n \n Similar prior attempts, Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF) (1960's), Chiang Mai Initiative (2000), and BancoSur (2009) have met various levels of success.   The two most recent attempts were delayed or stalled by the inability of all participants to come to agreements on issues such as \"\"tax-free status, the role of concessional finance, relationships with the private sector, transparency rules, and the need for environmental safeguards.\"\n \n Russia is currently out of step with the rest of the world, China's economic size dominates the other partners, Brazil's economy is a burst bubble - all factors that further reduce the likelihood after agreements being reached quickly.  I'm not saying it won't happen, just that it would be lightning speed to happen in 9 months.",
        "I agree with MrRunner19, that this question dovetails with the long range missile test.  I approach everything North Korea does from a geopolitical angle first, and then technical necessity second.  i.e.  Missile tests as a signal rather than to prove that the missiles work. Therefore, NK is more likely to launch missiles, or stage something like the US prisoner interviews this past weekend, than test a nuclear device.\n \n However, http://38north.org/2014/04/jlewis040414/  from April 2014 talks about North Korea conducting \"It would not rule out a new form of nuclear test for bolstering up its nuclear deterrence.\"  (http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2014/201403/news30/20140330-15ee.html)\n The 38North article speculates that the test could be \n salvo(more than one device), vertical mine shaft to accommodate larger device, or air test.  The air test is considered unlikely because of potential radioactive fallout over Chine, NK main supporter.  Both a salvo and vertical mine would require additional resources over past test.\n \n Since the 38north article linked on the info page shows no current activity at the test site, and past tests have required 6-8 weeks of effort before a detonation, it appears time is running out on this question.  This question should be reviewed and test site activity monitored regularly.\n \n Another issue is the question requires a detonation of a device, an attempt that fails would not meet the resolution criteria.\n \n \n ",

There may be some translations issues driving this, or willful misreading of his comments being used to pressure China. \n \n My limited understanding of China suggests that the government, especially when it comes to economic development, announces but does not explain its actions.

        "I need to know more about the consensus in the Obama administration. Most of the world waits to see what the US will do before this type of incursion into foreign territory. \n \n It is important to remember international law. There are really only two basic means to justify a military invasion on foreign soil: (1) UN Security Council authorization and (2) self-defense, including collective self-defense. This means that we cannot intervene legally without Syria's authorization unless we have a majority of the UNSC, including all permanent members, authorize it first. Syria has already explicitly refused international help, at least from us: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/syria-says-its-ready-to-cooperate-to-fight-islamist-militants/article20189234/ Obama is typically respectful of international law, as is most of the rest of the world. The loan exception capable of such an attack is Israel, and they have very little incentive to help stabilize the Syrian government.\n \n Even after UNSC Resolution 1973, Obama was very tentative and skeptical of attacking Libya, for instance. Biden, if I remember correctly, was plainly against it. Clinton was for it. Clinton is no longer a member of the administration, while Biden obviously remains.\n \n The last important fact to remember is the baseline US activity in the country. We have been aiding certain \"moderate\" rebels for a long time. They are already attacking the IS rebels (eg. This: http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/08/28/found_the_islamic_state_terror_laptop_of_doom_bubonic_plague_weapons_of_mass_destruction_exclusive). The existing Obama administration strategy seems to be to try to help the \"moderates\" end up on top of the rubble when the civil war concludes. This type of covert activity is explicitly excluded in the clarifications.\n \n With the US government's policy of providing aid and monitoring the situation, I think the only way the US would intervene would be if the situation deteriorates. Even then, the US would likely wait until the Syrian government approved it out of desperation. Even a UNSC resolution would probably hinge on Syrian support, as Russia, a permanent member with veto power, is a Syrian ally.\n \n The last possibility I can imagine is that Syria consents to an intervention of Russia or a Middle Eastern ally. Again, this would be likely only in desperation.",

In order to determine what may happen, absent the many wild cards' in this situation--no one saw MH17 getting shot down during this--let's review what we believe we know about Mr. Putin and Russia to this point with Ukraine. A quick summary: \n \n --Russia acts in Ukraine after the uprising (Feb. 2014) a day after the White House explicitly states that Russia should stay out of the situation.\n --White House and EU condemn Russia's plan to annex Crimea, Russia does it anyway.\n --Putin claims that Russian troops are not involved, yet there are Russian speaking troops wearing unmarked uniforms, that are clearly trained military, with heavy military equipment that magically appeared. \n --Putin said he reserved the right to defend Russian speaking minorities in a civil war.\n --The West, the U.S. and EU initiate light sanctions on Russia. Nothing changes in Ukraine with Russia.\n --Putin has said that, \"The breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century.\"\n --New and tougher sanctions from the EU and US after MH17, yet there is no reverse of support from Russia of rebels.\n --US satellite images appear to show rockets being fired from the Russian side of the border (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/27/satellite-images-us-show-russian-rocket-fire-into-ukraine)\n --Putin's approval numbers in Russia are at all time highs since the crisis, which can further embolden Putin in Ukraine.\n --\"Humanitarian aid\" trucks sent in from Russia, despite international statements that it would be a violation of international law and a provocation if it happened. The West does nothing in response.\n --Must remember what happened in Georgia in 2006 by Russia.\n \n Based on what has happened so far I believe it shows that 1). Putin cannot be trusted 2). Russia is not being deterred by the sanctions, and has even been emboldened by weak response 3). Russia is operating under a policy of semi \"plausible deniability\" for actions, i.e. unidentified troops, \"humanitarian aid\" 4). Putin wants to rebuild Russia's influence to what it was like under the Soviet Union. 5.) It appears Russia is looking to bait Ukraine into a military confrontation that will result in Russia being able to use open military force. 6.) The situation appears to be continuing to deteriorate.\n \n In regards to the latest \"humanitarian aid\" truck invasion into Ukraine, while Ukraine leaders classify it as a \"direct invasion\" they have \"ruled out the use of force against the convoy....Western leaders fear the convoy could serve as a pretext for direct Russian intervention in the conflict between government forces and pro-Russia rebels....\"(http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/russian-convoy-crosses-border-ukraine-without-permission) A senior British security official states that, \"the Kremlin is well down the route of plotting a military invasion. Such a move was going to be \"low-level\" they said, but was likely to accompany the aid convoy as some kind of peacekeeping initiative....NATO also said the aid initiative had coincided with a big ramp-up of Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine since mid-August. \"Russian artillery support - both cross-border and from within Ukraine - is being employed against the Ukrainian armed forces,\" said spokesperson Oana Lungescu. \"Since mid-August we have multiple reports of the direct involvement of Russian forces including airborne, air defence and special operations forces in Eastern Ukraine.\" (http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4426dc70-29de-11e4-914f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3BFlKw3v8)\n \n I believe that absent help from Russia, the rebel fighters will be unable to hold out for another month against a Ukrainian offensive, prompting the question of what Russia will do? A direct confrontation between Ukrainian and Russian military forces is the next logical step to happen, yet I'm unsure whether Russia would go so far, as this would probably prompt a NATO response of peacekeepers being sent in, which would not be in Russia's interest--the status quo of keeping Ukraine destabilized with rebels is Russia's interest. Currently it seems Ukraine has adopted the policy of being passive towards Russian aggression, in order to avoid a military confrontation and not give Putin the chance to allege provocation. \n \n In conclusion, I feel that absent a wild card of a Ukrainian or Russian soldier just cutting lose from policy--which in high tension situations could happen--there will not be a direct open and lethal confrontation involving Russia and Ukrainian national forces before Oct. 1st. \n \n \n \n ",

        "It appears that based on the latest polls and information coming out of the United Kingdom and Scotland, that the Scottish bid for independence will most likely fail. A poll released on August 15 showed that Scottish voters will reject independence, with 51 per cent backing the Union and just 38 per cent supporting independence. And in the latest poll-of-polls on August 15, this showed 57 per cent said they wanted to stay with the Union, while 43 per cent opted for independence, showing a clear lead of 14 per cent for the Better Together campaign.  (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11045624/Scottish-independence-referendum-the-latest-poll-tracker.html). Still with those poll numbers, it is not entirely certain that the \"Better Together\" campaign will be successful-some factors to consider is that the Scottish Nationalist party which is in all out favour of independence, holds a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and in the most recent vote, the vote for independence was 61 to 47, which could very well reflect a lot of public sentiment going into the vote (http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-go-out-and-win-salmond-1-3517627). Additionally, the Scottish National Party has a history of pulling off upset wins. In 2011's parliamentary elections, the SNP won 45% of the vote, despite polls projecting support at almost half that two months before election day. The SNP is known for their proficiency in galvanising support through social media and on-the-ground community organisation, yet whether this will make the difference in the vote this go around is unknown. (http://www.newsweek.com/british-pm-brands-scottish-independence-claims-desperate-polls-narrow-265683). \n \n I also believe it is important to not overlook the language of the question that will be put before voters, \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" viewed in the context of what we are currently witnessing around the world, with various independent movements-whether the Arab Spring, the push for Catalonian independence in Spain, the never ending \"Quebec\" vs. Canada question, as well as, the nationalist movements rising on the European continent in recent elections, and even the rise of the Tea Party in the U.S.-all movements by large passionate groups of people against the political establishments and demanding major political changes. I believe we cannot view Scotland's vote alone in a vacuum for what we're seeing happen with \"independence\" in these other countries. Yet even with all of that, I believe there are too many unresolved questions among Scots about how it would work, the latest estimates about oil reserves off their coast, the currency question, and still enough British pride, equal to Scottish pride that the vote will still fail, although close. I still give it a 20% chance of being successful, because there will be a final debate between the sides on Aug. 25th that could have an impact--although I doubt it will swing it.

In some senses this question may dovetail with the long-range missile test question in that respect.

I know one could say apples and oranges considering one is a sovereign state and member of the P-5 and the other a terrorist group turned de facto state the size of Jordan, but the common link between them is an appetite for territorial expansion/annexation.\n \n Links: http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/anne-applebaum-war-in-europe-is-not-a-hysterical-idea/2014/08/29/815f29d4-2f93-11e4-bb9b-997ae96fad33_story.html\n \n http://www.vox.com/2014/8/28/6080589/putin-ukraines-rebels-novorossiya",

(This makes me a bit wary about the quality of this question, but that is another matter.) Anyway, depending on the outcome of US airstrikes in Iraq, there might be more support for such tactics in Syria to support anti-ISIL groups there. The question says the intervention has to be against \"armed groups in Syria\", not specifically the Assad regime, so this is a factor that raises chances in my opinion. \n \n Here's a VICE video (a bit dated now) from the Syrian-Turkish border that alludes to US support of groups fighting ISIL, as opposed to the past support of anti-regime groups: https://news.vice.com/video/syria-the-long-war-dispatch-one",

        "This graph seems to say it best- http://whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/should-scotland-be-an-independent-country-1#line - over the past year and half it has been very rare that a yes vote even came close to equalling a no vote (only on 7 polling days or so over the whole year and a half)... and even at it's highest the yes vote is 6 percentage points below the needed 50% to make the referendum pass.  So the likelihood is low that it will pass, however there is a sentiment of nationalistic pride that is pushing a yes vote.

Furthermore, there is a deeper recognition that Syria is the stem from which ISIS springs from- it's roots deep in the Shia v. Sunni divisions playing out their violent age-old vendettas.  Thus it seems only a matter of time until there is something done to definitively address ISIS and its Syrian bases of operations, as well as changing the dynamics of the Syrian state i.e. the oppression of the Assad regime and the reactions to it that created the dynamics that birthed ISIS in the first place.  \n At the very least, dedicated airstrikes will be necessary.  \n \n There is a possibility that the damage done to ISIS in Iraq will cause the tides to change in Syria and therefore strikes may not be necessary, but this is unlikely at best as ISIS is dug in and operationally savvy.  \n \n The giant leap was striking in Iraq, it's politically easier to extend the campaign to Syria especially now when Assad is so weakened, barely maintaining control nominally of key strongholds and a bed fellow of the much maligned Russians... In fact Assad would likely welcome airstrikes on ISIS targets, he needs all the help he can get.

        "As an avid listener of NPR on my daily commute, I recalled a piece on air regarding IS / ISIS / ISIL, \"What's in a Name?\". Only recalling portions of the  news piece, I first thought of going back and looking at the transliteration of the organization name and its potential meaning. \n \n Transliteration of the ISIS/ISIL name is \"al-Dawlah al-Islamiyah fi al-'Iraq wa-al-Sham\". The portion we will be scrutinizing is al-Sham. Translated, al-Sham means either Levant or Greater Syria depending on the translation. Look up al-Sham on Wikiperdia and it redirects to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_(region). The area referenced does include portions of Jordan, one of the five countries named in the question. \n \n Second, we must look at maps of control and operations by ISIS. The maps referenced below from the nytimes.com give great information regarding areas under the influence of ISIS, but it is difficult to see the roads on the map. The second listing from aljazeera.net has much better clarity for major roads through the countries and show the areas of conflict. \n \n By superimposing the areas together, it is clear that ISIS aims to control the main arteries for transportation throughout the countries, which also would coincide with population centers and key areas. Their strategy is to link villages together by moving down these major roads and take control however necessary.\n \n A general map of the Middle East shows that Saudia Arabia and Jordan are both countries that share borders with Iraq. Jordan also borders Syria. By looking at the sites of conflict, it seems that the roads to Saudi Arabia seem to be safe for the time being. The major roads from Iraq to Jordan are a different story.\n \n By looking at the maps, we see that ISIS has control of Ar Rutbah (Rutba) in the Al Anbar province of Iraq, which is about 70 miles (110 km) from the border with Jordan. The status of the Tarbil border crossing with Jordan seems to remain in an unknown status. It would seem to indicate that either Sunni tribesmen control it, or it is controlled by ISIS with a low profile. \n \n Furthermore, we have seen threats from ISIS to Jordan and King Abdullah II. However, would this indicate an imminent threat? Yes, and no. \n \n After Iraq and Syria, ISIS would certainly target Lebanon and Jordan as the next areas for expansion. While ISIS is categorized as a bunch of terrorists, they are much different from other groups we have seen before. Their goal is to establish a new caliphate, which they have technically declared already, and building their own state. What constitutes a state? Would a state be loosely defined as people, territory, resources, finance, and a government? ISIS has all of the above. \n \n Generally speaking, the ISIS support base is built upon Sunni Muslims. The areas of fighting? Against Shia and Kurdish Muslims, and any other secular faction in their path. As a result, ISIS will tend to cater to their base of support in the Sunni communities and attempt to dominate in order to build their state. From a religious perspective, Jordan is roughly 92% Muslim with the vast majority Sunni. \n \n While unrest in Jordan would really send shockwaves through the Middle East and rattle Israel, its neighbor, ISIS may not be prepared to open that front just yet. Most likely, they will continue to press their advantages in Iraq to topple the weak government, and consolidate its forces with their march west to finish off Syria.\n \n In summary, would ISIS mount a large scale attack on Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, or the United Arab Emirates before 1 February 2015? Probably not. Would elements potentially viewed as aligned with ISIS or affiliates stir up trouble in any one of these countries? Probably, yes. However, it is imperative to watch what happens closely in the area, as well as reactions from the US and Israel should ISIS continue to push further west.\n \n \n Map Resources:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?_r=0\n \n http://webapps.aljazeera.net/aje/custom/2014/ISILpaththruiraq/index.html\n \n \n Other references:\n \n http://icsr.info/2013/12/icsr-insight-11000-foreign-fighters-syria-steep-rise-among-western-europeans/\n \n http://www.mintpressnews.com/the-key-to-stop-isis-from-spreading-to-jordan-rests-in-iraq/196095/",

        "In the past year (trailing twelve months), there have been 15 trade disputes. 7 of the 15 disputes in the past twelve months have targeted the EU, Canada, or the US. Historically, the majority of disputes have been against the EU and the US.\n \n The Russian Federation has initiated a pair of trade disputes with the EU, which were reciprocated by the EU. The Russian Federation has not initiated a dispute with Canada or the United States during the past twelve month period.\n \n Looking back at historical information of disputes by country, it appears as if the Russian Federation has only ever initiated two disputes, being the aforementioned against the EU.\n \n Russia's complaint regarding the EU's energy sector measures were filed back on April 30, 2014. Most likely this filing will cover the basis for limiting energy trade with Russia. This area seems to be the most sensitive between the Russia and EU, as Russia's energy exports are significant portion of their GDP. \n \n As of 2012, oil and gas sector accounted for 16% of the GDP, 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports. Russian oil and natural gas are their chief export to the EU, the largest consumer of these products. These stats seem to indicate that the Russians are heavily dependent on EU consumption and demand for their energy products.\n \n In summary, it seems unlikely that the Russian Federation will initiate a WTO dispute against the EU, Canada, or the US given its past track record of sparse disputes. Furthermore, the most sensitive area of the Russian economy and most likely source of a dispute is already on the table for the EU, the largest consumer of Russian energy products.

        "I've been waiting for this question!\n \n So this is a pretty neat, decades long sourced, recently polled study by a independent and US funded Hong Kong group called Hong Kong Transition Project.\n If the data is accurate, Occupy is not majority popular, lacks popular support from the poorest, the unemployed, blue collar workers, and women. Its biggest supporters are those making around 100k and/or the college educated.\n http://www.hktp.org/list/constitutional-reform-brief.pdf\n \n Also, as another point, it seems like police have been effective enough. They're not getting rid of the protests completely, but they've been effective enough.\n http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/10/hong-kong-police-clear-protest-barricades-2014101512237584208.html\n \n CY Leung is being investigated, giving Beijing a reason to pressure him to step down so they can replace him with a different Beijing-friendly leader.\n http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/hong-kong-chief-executive-cy-leung-faces-questions-over-secret-7m-payout-from-australian-firm-20141008-1134yv.html#ixzz3FXFIkmAx\n \n The police have also been allowing triad (read: Chinese mafia) members, paid mainlander thugs/poor folks, and anti-HK protesters across barricades to beat up HK protesters. Keep in mind most of the protesters are wealthy college kids - they don't want to be victims of violence and many of them have the resources to simply leave HK if it comes down to that. Don't think of these protesters in the same line as Tiananmen, or the US Civil Rights movements of the 1960s. \n Also keep this in mind: When Beijing wants to use the stick against these protests, they have thugs who aren't associated with the PRC to do that. This allows Westerners to think that the HK protests aren't that popular (which, really, they're not) while keeping Beijing's hands clean.\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/10/03/hong-kongs-battle-lines-harden-after-mob-attacks-protesters/\n \n Quite a few people think this will end up like Tiananmen. Couple reasons I disagree with this:\n 1) The political and economic climate today: the PRC has integrated itself into too many markets to try something so drastic, especially when they have other avenues to pursue in reducing tensions in HK. This would also be a blow to their soft power which they've been trying to cultivate over the past decade, and would give Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam excuses to be more bullish against China's attempts at encroachment via the ADIZ and spats over islands (in Taiwan's case, Taiwan itself).\n 2) Before Tiananmen, there was another large student protest in 1986 that was suppressed through non-violent means. Part of the reason Tiananmen blew up into such an event and fiasco was the schism in PRC leadership at the time between Zhao Ziyang (in favor of political reforms) and Deng Xiaoping + Li Peng (more hardline) - this was also at the time when much of the Soviet Eastern Block was falling, and the PRC hardline leadership essentially faced a real possibility of the PRC dictatorship and government structure crumbling if Tiananmen continued.\n There is no such risk with these protests, and there is no such mainland support for these protests. The greatest risk to the PRC in giving in to these protests is the setting of precedent.\n \n \n So overall, here's how I see this playing out:\n The CY Leung investigation will blow up and be handed to ICAC. The result will be Leung being forced to step down.\n Beijing will take the stance of \"Look, we didn't interfere to protect Leung. He's obviously not a puppet - he was corrupt and dealt with accordingly. This is a perfect example of the 'one country, two systems' relationship you want.\"\n Beijing will replace Leung with a more competent yet still pro-Beijing leader.\n Beijing will pass this lack of intervention off as a concession to the Scholarism/Occupy Central movement's demands (keeping in mind it's likely a source from Beijing was the original leak to Garnaut to kick that investigation off). The replacement will probably stage talks with OC, but nothing will come of them.\n No meaningful longterm changes will occur (at least, not by 12/2014). The protests will dissipate as Leung gets removed and talks ensue (and also as people need to return to their jobs/classes, leadership in the Scholarism movement falters, etc). Disenchanted students and protesters will leave HK, creating voids that will be filled with rising mainlander upper-middle class and upper-class citizens who can afford the laughably high HK housing prices and want to live in the veritable shopping mall that HK is becoming.",
        "Per the STOXX site linked on GJP, VSTOXX hit just north of 22 in July.

Akinak is correct to note that the Scottish referendum plays into this as well, along with (if Scotland breaks away) possible Catalan (and maybe even Basque) follow-up referendums in Spain and, if things take a drastic turn in Italy, the possibility of a North/South split there, too.\n \n All of these things along with the long timeframe for the question lead me to start off with a high probability.

        "Following teammates.\n \n Obviously after Pres. Obama's speech US military intervention is on the table and likely. We can't degrade or destroy ISIS while leaving them all their current Syrian territory. If they are to lose this area to an army, it looks more likely to be at the hands of the Kurds (at least as far as Syrian Kurdistan) than Assad's troops or other Syrian rebel groups (given recent ceasefires by the latter with ISIS, which will result in Syrian national and rebel troops refocusing on each other). If the Kurds do advance into Syria, support from American airstrikes seems likely.\n \n Incidentally, a previous headline used imprecise terminology: Obama authorized airstrikes in Syria, but he didn't *order* them.\n \n I can also see Israel feeling free to intervene in Syria, though ISIS may be less likely to push its Golan and Lebanese fronts if it starts suffering from air strikes and emboldened enemies like the Kurds. Alternatively, if ISIS suffers enough in Iraq and eastern Syria, it may be forced from army-with-territory mode back into terror-group/militia mode. Though, if they do suffer losses in eastern Syria, that also will most likely be the result of a campaign including US airstrikes.\n \n I can't see any other national military intervening in Syria.\n \n Another long-shot scenario: If the Iraqi national government continues to collapse as a post-WWI fiction, and the Kurds continue to demonstrate professionalism and inclusive governance, calls for Kurdish statehood will probably continue to increase as well. This probably wouldn't happen before 1 Dec., but if it did, then Kurdish military intervention in Syria would qualify as a Yes resolution. In this case, whose determination of their statehood would be official for purposes of this question? The US? The UN?",
        "So fascinating that this question ends in June and not February! Federal elections in Nigeria are scheduled for February, which means the question wonders if the backlash to his winning (should he win) be so great that he will be forced to leave.\n \n The background is this: There had been an unwritten understanding that the presidency would alternate between a southern Christian and a northern Muslim. This system was thrown into chaos when Umaru Yar'Adua, the Muslim elected in 2007, died in office in 2011. Elections held after his death resulted in Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian, winning, which angered Muslims who thought that a Muslim should have been chosen to (at least) finish out Yar'Adua's term.\n \n President Jonathan's term has been plagued by: typical Nigerian oil-based corruption; increase in piracy in the Gulf of Guinea (also largely oil-based); the rise of Boko Haram; among others.\n \n Now that Jonathan is planning to run *again*, northern Muslims are even more upset, and if he wins, the feeling that the Nigerian state has abandoned them is inevitable. This could lead northerners to deny the legitimacy of the Abuja government altogether (as Boko Haram already has).\n \n So as I mentioned, this question can be resolved YES either a) by his losing the election or b) by him winning but subsequently vacating.\n \n A. Will he win the election?\n \n This seems likely, based on the heavy advantage incumbents have (even more than in the US):\n \"The president still appears to be in a strong position, partly because there is no clear alternative, but also because Nigerian elections tend to be fought more on vast patronage than on policy, which gives an encumbent in this oil-rich state an advantage.\"\n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/29/us-nigeria-election-idUSKBN0II1G720141029\n \n I'll track his chances as elections draw near, but right now I'll give him a 90% chance of winning.\n \n B. Assuming he wins, will he vacate?\n \n If he wins, he will definitely lose legitimacy, but assuming the election violence and fraud can be kept to a minimum (at least as far as can be determined) so that international pressure is kept at bay, he will probably retain support from the more populous south, which contains both Nigeria's oil and the supporters benefiting from the regime's oil-based patronage.\n \n What would have to happen for him to vacate after winning? Probably one or more of the following: widespread, publicized election fraud; major unrest throughout the north, not just in the northeast where Boko Haram operates; international pressure strong enough to convince Jonathan or (more likely) the people whose support he buys with oil money that he needs to go.\n \n Assuming he wins the election, I'll go with a 20% chance that events will precipitate him leaving office. This means I think he's more likely to leave by force (20%) than by losing the election (10%).\n \n So let me see if my math works here. There are three possible outcomes:\n a) He loses the election (10%)\n b) He wins the election but is forced out (20% of the remaining 90% = 18%)\n c) He wins the election and stays through June 10 (80% of the remaining 90% = 72%)\n \n So that's what I think I think. For gaming purposes, I will start with 0% and adjust upward as events suggest otherwise.",

        "Good analysis by everyone so far. Here are some additional thoughts.\n \n The annexation of Crimea is different from the possible annexation of eastern Ukraine: It is more militarily essential to Russia as the home of Russia's fleet (there are no suitable ports in Russia's Black Sea coast); and it was easier to pretend legitimacy based on history and ethnicity: it was not always part of Ukraine, unlike Donetsk and other eastern areas. So I think the same motivations behind the Crimea annexation are not necessarily in play in eastern Ukraine.\n \n Moreover, officially annexing eastern Ukraine is more a direct challenge to the existence of Ukraine as a state, which Crimea was not, so I think there are additional preventive factors in play in Eastern Ukraine. Putin has never given ground on the pretense that the uprising in the East is primarily Ukrainian rather than Russian, despite all evidence to the contrary. In fact, he portrays it as the true, legitimate voice of Ukraine, opposing the illegitimate revolution based in Kiev. Russia may end up with de facto control over much of eastern Ukraine, but as long as Ukraine exists as a state, I see no reason for Putin to give up on his narrative of legitimacy, which emphasizes the role of western meddling in producing the pro-Western Orange and Maidan Revolutions, and denying Russian interference/involvement in the corresponding pro-Russian movements. So making the Russian annexation of eastern Ukraine official would mean giving up one of Putin's primary propaganda mechanisms against the West.\n \n Finally, a common thread of analysis on Putin is that he is challenging traditional international structures and customs. He does not feel the need, for example, to declare or even acknowledge a war in order to wage it. So whatever he seeks to gain by controlling eastern Ukraine, he will unlikely acknowledge it in official terms the West can point to and hang a coalition on. But that is precisely the object of this question. Thus even though I think it *very* likely that Russia, with its vastly superior military and Ukraine's lack of willing military partners, will succeed in *de facto* annexation of additional Ukrainian territory, I judge the question, hanging on the term \"officially\", very unlikely.\n \n Still, Putin is not entirely predictable, and if he continues to see weakness in the West, he may see the benefit of challenging the West with an \"official\" annexation. We've certainly never given him much bother over his unofficial ones, starting with Georgia. This accounts for my 20%.",

Therefore, Russia is unwilling to incur major risks to force the North Koreans to renounce their nuclear weapons ambitions. Russian officials oppose strong sanctions that could precipitate North Korea's collapse into a failed state. They seek to change Pyongyang's behavior, but not its regime. Russia remains more concerned about the economic and security consequences of the DPRK's collapse for Russia than Pyongyang's intransigence and provocations.\"\n \n But things seem to move slowly in North Korea so my guess is while the 2 countries may get together to conduct joint military exercises, I doubt it will before 10 June 2015.  The 2 leaders, if they get together at all, won't until May which further adds to the lost % of chance this will happen before 10 June 2015.

As there is a 41 year-old US ban on exporting crude, the WTI supply and pricing fluctuate with some independence from global market, though of course there is convergence. The index ties to price deviations from the mean daily price of WTI; if the price moves a lot, up or down, the OVX rises. If the price changes little, the OVX falls.\n \n Historic models of cycles suggest that low oil prices will have to rise (though analysts predict lower prices this week for Brent Crude, OPEC) and late Spring would be, seasonally, a likely period for that.\n \n As always, the oil trade is affected by political disturbances, though it has remained surprisingly static through turbulence in Ukraine and the Middle East this year.  \n \n Reading through the news feed, I find that the investors refer to oil generally as being \"range-bound,\" not moving far from its current pricing.

He further stated the goal was \"to form a regional collective security\" as a counterpoint to US focus on the asian region. \n \n China is trending its efforts towards creating an expeditionary type force in its modernization efforts as evidenced by new construction in the Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), as well as in conducting exercises well away from home waters such as with Iran in the Arabian Sea. \n \n Both countries have conducted joint operations in the past.

Pakistan, which has considerable influence with the Taliban, has bluntly told the Taliban to come to consensus before negotiating with the Afghanistan government as it is looking to end the growing escalation/spread of violence on its borders. Additionally, China has begun taking major steps in the country (reopening the Wahkun corridor for example) investing in natural resources, the economy and regional security. It has been reported that they might be possibly facilitating dialogue between the two sides in Pakistan as recently as late February 2015 (REUTERS 12MAR15)\n        \n  Secondly the perception or presence of US influence on the dialogue process.\n    In the past the Taliban has insisted on the removal of US forces before considering any negotiations.  The recent withdrawal of US troops to a small training level of approximately 12000 with a complete end of US troop presence scheduled for late 2016 may be sufficient. This would also allay the Afghan governments desire for some type of US presence to provide stability, appease US concerns/demands while also being sufficient enough for the Taliban to accept for the purposes of entering into any process.\n \n   With the influence of Pakistan and China as well as the imminent withdrawal of US forces, conditions are conducive to discussions taking place.\n \n ",

        "Although Putin has recently announced publicly that Russia \"..will do everything in its power so that this conflict is ended..\"and appears now to be more conciliatory,this is in stark contrast to events on the ground.\n   Putin stated in May that Russia was removing forces from the border however it did not. Russia has actually increased its troop levels and continued to transfer heavy equipment to pro Russian separatist forces. On 15AUG14, NATO accused Russian military forces of actually crossing the eastern Ukraine border. NATO has reported that some of these units are artillery units that are firing on Ukrainian National forces from both within Ukrainian territory and from Russian territory.\n  I believe Russia will continue to provide arms,equipment and manpower to pro separatist \"militias\". Russia will also utilize direct support in the form of artillery or possibly airstrikes,methods which can be denied if accused. I also feel that the probability of a lethal confrontation will increase as Ukrainian forces gain against separatist forces. \n ",

Putin already got his prize in Crimea, and the natural gas pipeline he wanted to build through that territory.  This eastern Ukrainian proxy war is probably a way to preoccupy the Ukranians long enough to consolidate his gains, put the Malaysian airline disaster in the rear view mirror, and scare the bejeezus out of the other nations in their historical \"near abroad\" who will now think twice before they poke the bear.

In the most recent review (in November 2010), the weights of the currencies in the SDR basket were revised based on the value of the exports of goods and services and the amount of reserves denominated in the respective currencies that were held by other members of the IMF. These changes became effective on January 1, 2011. In October 2011, the IMF Executive Board discussed possible options for broadening the SDR currency basket. Most directors held the view that the current criteria for SDR basket selection remained appropriate. The next review will take place by 2015.\"\n \n Although the Reuters piece mentions that there may be growing pressure on the IMF to include the renminbi in SDRs, there didn't seem to be anything urgent about it. I would expect the IMF will make its review next year, most likely announce it during the autumn meetings, and make it effective as of Jan. 1, 2016. There is a slight chance, if pressure increases for some reason, that they might announce it at the spring meetings of 2015 and will keep my ears open, but at this point I see no real urgency.",

        "In late 2013, commentators were assuming that Rousseff would win re-election because of her rising poll numbers.  However, they have declined over time as support for the Socialist Party increased.  With the recent death of PSB (Socialist) candidate Campos, and his replacement by Silva, a run-off seems even more certain.\n \n In an August 18 poll (the most recent poll I could find), Silva had 21% of the vote, which was 3 times more than Campos, who she has replaced.  Support for Rousseff has not changed in over a month, and is sitting at 36 percent, while Neves has remained constant at 20%, showing that Silva's increase came from undecided voters.  The poll showed Silva depriving Rousseff of the votes she needs to win the election outright in the first round of voting on Oct. 5. It also showed Silva ahead of Rousseff by 4 percentage points if there is a runoff between the two.\n (http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/18/uk-brazil-election-idUKKBN0GI0HJ20140818)\n Additionally, Rousseff was widely booed in the recent World Cup--what we can conclude from this is that her opponents are likely to be vocal enough and active enough to vote on election day.\n \n Also, Brazil's 2010 Presidential election had a nearly 80% turnout rate of eligible voters, implying that the polling data we see should hold strong on election day.  Brazil also has compulsory voting, where eligible voters are required to vote, though the sanctions for not voting are not usually enforced.\n (http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=BR)\n \n While it is debatable whether Rousseff will ultimately win the election, it seems highly likely, based on the election process, that no one candidate will earn more than 50% of the vote in the first round.",

China, not a signatory on the INF, is increasing its cruise missile capability and while a notional ally of Russia, is also a potential foe (especially on the eastern border where the Chinese population outnumbers the Russian one).\n 4. To compensate for Russian deficiencies in the air/sea arena. Russia is a ground power, with air/sea forces serving to augment the ground element and to serve as a strategic deterrent.

        "Polling: 'No' is consistently receiving around 50% in polling, 'Yes' around 35%, and the remainder undecided. If the 'No' side is able to maintain this, and gain just a handful of the undecided voters, the referendum will fail. \n \n \n \n The Scottish National Party has been promising a referendum for years now, and their vocal leader, Alex Salmond, claims that Scotland would benefit economically from control over the North Sea oil resources. Also national pride, self-rule, etc. that appeals to patriotic Scots.\n \n Nearly all parties beside Salmond and his supporters believes that independence would hurt Scotland economically.

The closest parallels are in Quebec and Catalunya. These regions have clearer cultural and linguistic differences than Scotland and England, and more history of separatist agitation. In the case of Catalunya, a wealthy region of Spain, the economic case for independence is more clear.

        "Brazilian presidential elections require winning a majority of votes in the first round to prevent a runoff election from taking place. The leading candidate, incumbent Dilma Rousseff, has been consistently well below 50% in pre-election polls; pre-World Cup polls had her receiving around 40% in the first round, a number that has been gradually falling. The most recent (8/15, Datafolha) data has her receiving just 36%. \n \n The recent death of Eduardo Campos has cleared a path for his running mate, Marina Silva, to take his place. Silva is quite popular in some segments of the Brazilian electorate, with a humble background, concern for the environment, and deep Catholic faith. She was a founding member of Rousseff's Worker's Party, and served as a minister under her predecessor, Lula. Polling conducted in the aftermath of Campos' plane crash showed Silva with 21% of the vote, and suggested she would be competitive in a runoff against Rousseff. \n \n With Rousseff at 36%, Silva with 21%, and center-right challenger Neves at 20%, Rousseff would need to win about 2/3 of the undecided voters in the first round to win without a runoff, a highly unlikely feat given her relative unpopularity due to a stagnating economy and an expensive World Cup. Assuming all 3 candidates remain in the race, it is highly improbable that any one of them is able to win a majority. I leave a few percentage points open to allow for unexpected scandals, deaths, etc. that could lead to Rousseff attracting votes from the other 2 candidates or the undecideds.",
        "I agree with Nexus's reasoning. I would add that additional official acts of Russian expansionism are likely to draw further criticism and repercussions from Western powers, causing further harm to Russia's economy and reputation. I believe Putin's ideal scenario is a highly autonomous Eastern Ukraine which effectively answers to the Kremlin, while nominally remaining part of Ukraine. This allows Western leaders to respond weakly while still saving face, whereas more aggressive actions would almost demand a more forceful response. Whatever additional benefits Russia would receive from annexing the rebel-held areas would likely be outweighed by the negative ramifications of embracing the role of aggressor. \n \n A scenario in which Russia does annex the separatist regions could unfold if the Ukrainian army goes back on the offensive and attempts to retake the Eastern regions, causing heavy damage and civilian casualties in the process. Then, Russia could more justifiably intervene militarily; either under the pretext of humanitarian/peacekeeping purposes, or unofficially, as they did recently when the Ukrainian army came close to encircling Donetsk.",

        "I don't think it's particularly likely. As Nienna and Fairplay stated, the dominant producer in OPEC is Saudi Arabia, who need only 90$/barrel prices to balance their budget. While this is above the current price, OPEC is realizing that its price-setting powers are diminishing as Chinese demand slumps and more production comes online from Russia, Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The Saudis are more concerned with fighting for market share at this point, and are likely willing to accept lower prices for the time being to ensure their continued exports dominance when prices rise again.\n \n A couple decades ago, we very well might have seen an output cut. Were OPEC to cut now, however, and raise global oil prices, they would also incentivize increased exploration and production in newly accessible deposits and further increase supply and decrease their market share. \n \n Thought this WSJ blog post did a good job summing up: http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/10/17/opecs-not-so-slick-on-oil-prices-now/. From the article:\n \n  \"Any OPEC supply cut would have to be in the order of 1 million barrels of oil per day to balance market supply and demand, analysts estimate. Last month it produced 30.7 million barrels in total. However, the International Energy Agency forecasts demand for OPEC oil will be some 1.4 million barrels a day lower next year, at 29.3 million barrels a day.\n The Paris-based energy watchdog also expects non-OPEC production to rise by 1.2 million barrels a day in 2015. In other words, even if OPEC did agree to a large cut to balance the market, it would only be making room for competing oil volumes.\"",

After accounting for\n seasonal factors, the headline PMI recorded 57.6,\n compared to 59.1 in October. Although remaining well\n above the 50.0 mark that separates growth from\n expansion, the latest reading of the PMI was the lowest\n for six months.  November's survey data indicated the continued\n expansion of non-oil private sector output, in line with\n the trend throughout the survey history. However, the\n rate of growth continued to slow markedly, hitting an\n eight-month low amid some reports of increased\n competition and slower demand compared to earlier in\n the year.

Maybe ISDS is just a stalking horse issue that is representative of disagreement with general free trade deals by the left.\n \n Also, the comments have push the EU's ability to hear the comments into next Spring, which may affect the timeline.

The abductions are a major issue in Japan and Prime Minister Abe has staked his career on resolving it. NK will try to use the report as leverage for the ferry, but Abe will probably not allow the ferry until after progress has been demonstrated on the investigation. Abe is in a stronger political position here because NK will be blamed for any delays/issues in Japan.\n \n I would not expect any easing until after a sufficient report has been released. So the real question is when will NK do so? Hard to predict NK's actions, but reports indicate they need humanitarian aid. Japan has a lot of carrot to offer in negotiations (and is willing to do so), but NK could suffer serious blowback depending on the details of the abductions. I this is slightly more likely to happen by next summer than not, but ongoing investigation will be the key.",

Death occurs in about 8 or 9 days after symptoms:\n * http://www.livescience.com/47203-ebola-how-people-survive.html\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease\n \n \n Transmission:\n ------------\n Fruit bats seen as initial carrier; unclear if they migrate to Europe tho.  Looks like best tracking still limits them to Africa:\n * http://www.discoverwildlife.com/animals/fruit-bats-africas-greatest-mammal-migration\n * http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/science/link-to-african-ebola-found-in-bats-suggests-virus-is-more-widespread.html?_r=0\n \n Noteworthy that current 2014 outbreak presumed to have been started via Fruit Bat migration:\n http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/23/ebola-outbreak-blamed-on-fruit-bats-africa\n \n However transmission between fruit bat and human directly is difficult (e.g eating raw fruit bat meat), with indirect transmission to humans (e.g. via pigs or gorillas; who contract from fruit bats) more common.\n \n I'm expecting that EU and other countries will quarantine any transported livestock from Africa given threat of Ebola (however is difficult to be sure across all EU nations), therefore any infections via animal would be from cross-border migrations.... however admit its a bit of a wildcard.\n \n Human-to-human transmission requires very close contact with bodily fluids; so one would need prolonged contact with an infected person:\n http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/06/25/324941229/could-the-ebola-outbreak-spread-to-europe-or-the-u-s\n Unlikely this would occur on a plane (e.g.)... there have been a couple of past scenarios with Ebola on a plane:\n * 1996: Passenger flew to Johannesburg with clear symptoms.  He did not infect anyone during the flight from Gabon.\n * 2004: Passenger flew from Sierra Leone to London; once landed went straight to hospital where he was diagnosed.  Of the 188 people who had \"close contact\" (including 19 passengers on the flight), none caught the virus.\n \n Protocols:\n ---------\n CDC (here in US) is screening passengers who are reported as 'ill'; presumably hyper-focused on ensuring animals and human contagent does not cross borders.  Furthermore, CDC has set West African region on a Travel Alert 3 status, which recommends avoiding nonessential travel.  However... unclear if same precautions are being taken in _all_ eu states:\n * http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/qa.html\n \n Analysis:\n ========\n Big wildcard in that its tough to understand protocols for all EU countries; however Paris FR was specifically noted as a higher risk then other EU countries (see NPR link above).  That said - would expect France to have mature customs and quarantine procedures to identify folks & animals travelling from high-risk areas.\n \n Animal migration patterns is another wildcard; while primary carrier ([West African] fruit bats) are not seen as migrating that far from West Africa; there could be other migratory species.\n \n Given relatively short incubation phase and that humans are not contagious until symptoms emerge; I would think it would be fairly low risk that human-to-human contamination would occur.  Furthermore, community outreach (which as already begun) is seen as best way to combat Ebola spreading - - - so expecting #'s to peak in the near term and then start dropping.\n \n Therefore, ranking as relatively low that an EU case would occur.\n ",

        "Summary:\n =======\n \n Players\n -------\n * Bulgaria (BU): EU member; subject to EU laws.  Nearly wholly dependent on RU for gas/oil (currently through ukraine)\n * Russia (RU): Expand reach of Oil/Gas into Europe\n * EU/US: Reduce RU's ability to leverage energy as a political tool now (for Ukraine) and going forward.  At the same time looking to solidify energy security for populace\n \n \n Notes: \n ------\n * Roughly 33% of oil and 39% of gas for Europe comes from RU (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_in_the_European_energy_sector); approx half  of total gas from RU currently comes through Ukraine (http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28854089) South Stream pipeline is meant to diversify that amount through Ukraine; and to minimize risk to this crucial pipeline for all involved.  Initial project timelines were to be complete (incl. sections through Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungry and Solvenia) by Dec 2017.\n   - Given surge of renewables and cheap US coal/gas, unclear if south stream would actually achieve its original mission (http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fzhwhfGxbo0J:www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6871b0a2-2487-11e4-be8e-00144feabdc0.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us#axzz3DgYrZL3c) \n \n * Work stopped in June after tensions in Ukraine.  Bulgarian Energy Minister suspended bidding and execution of contracts until work can be brought in line with EU procedures.  Unclear if these declarations have or will actually result in suspension of work on pipeline however. http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28854089\n   - \"Complex negotiations\" anticipated to resolve EU compliance requirements to allow work to continue\n   - European Commission (EC) threatening punitive measures over south stream & is calling on Bulgaria to suspend construction. Implies that Bulgaria actually hasn't suspended work as they are declaring (in June and Aug). http://www.novinite.com/articles/163448/EC+Threatens+Punitive+Measures+against+Bulgaria,+Serbia+over+South+Stream\n  \n \n * Work on pipeline is being done by RU organization (Gazprom).  Given goals of US/EU to undermine RU power players & role of Gas/Oil in RU, stressing Gazprom would be an add'l win for US/EU to continue blocking progress.  Gazprom has started to publicly lay out a \"Plan B\" which goes through Turkey & Greece.  \n   - Could be taken as an indicator that RU and Gazprom don't see an early resolution to the Bulgarian blockage.\n   - While both Greece (current EU member with some severe economic issues w/EU org) and Turkey (current EU candidate) have ties to EU, both are seen as potentially receptive to the idea as outlined here: http://www.euractiv.com/sections/energy/south-stream-plan-b-opts-route-through-greece-and-turkey-307839\n   - Unclear what the financial and timeline impact would be should Gazprom fall back to Plan B\n   \n   \n Analysis:\n --------\n Given Bulgarias reluctant but eventual compliance to EU legislation & the potential impact the successful blockage of South Stream would have for both near-term EU/US political agenda (re: Ukraine) and the long term role of Ukraine in the region; it is very unlikely that Bulgaria will be able to move forward before end of 2014.\n \n Furthermore, given questions around viability of the pipeline's business benefits to the Gazprom org and emerging \"Plan B\" options by Gazprom/RU; I don't see there to be a lot of incentive by the major players to get a mutually beneficial agreement here.\n \n Items to watch\n -----------\n * Progress on RU and EU/US negotiations on Ukraine during this term.",
        "Question is a bit open-ended (meaning.. I don't read as lethal confrontation between US and Iran conveys specifically) & is a pretty chaotic area right now; however most of the chaos is land-based vs. sea-based.  I don't get the sense that land-based \"rebel\" fighters are focused on sea-based US assets.\n \n There is a small Yemini Navy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Navy), which may be compromised amongst all the chaos, but I would be drawing a long line to make a case of a coordinated attack from that angle.\n \n There is also a pattern of smaller ships confronting US Warships - with the last lethal attack being the US Cole back in 2000 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cole_bombing). A similar pattern was used in Persian gulf back in 2008-ish (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_U.S.%E2%80%93Iranian_naval_dispute).  While this one wasn't a lethal confrontation, the pattern of harassing us warships with smaller \"patrol\" boats is evident.  I figure that, if there were a lethal confrontation during the term of this question, it would be via some sort of attempt to get close to US warships using smaller patrol boats; presumably out of Yemen vs. Iran...\n \n Overall, I tend to agree with Laz that there is a low probability here - -- but plenty of \"wildcards\".",

        "The news of an ebola case here in Dallas is a bit shocking, but really shouldn't have been so.\n \n http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29437070\n \n The fact is that for the last month, both the CDC and WHO have been projecting increases in the number of ebola cases and neither believes that the outbreak has peaked yet.  In fact, projections do not go much beyond a month, but they are daunting.  Furthermore, ebola is a particularly dangerous variety of hemorrhagic fever given that the incubation period (~21 days) is much longer than it is for other related diseases such as Marburg.  Combine the long incubation period with the speed of modern travel, then it appears that an outbreak in the developed world is a near certainty.  Particularly France is vulnerable since the bulk of the international flights from the region go to Paris before proceeding to other European destinations.\n \n Additionally, I make a high for case given that there is still 8 months for a single case in Europe to force a \"yes\" result to this question.",

I sincerely doubt ISIS will have the means to make a meaningful attack into any of those territories considering its slow spread, it's gaining the attention of the West (to say the least), and the fact that it couldn't consolidate all of Iraq even if it wanted to. But if their overall goal is to reestablish a caliphate, and they have already lunged into Lebanon to seize a border town, I simply can't deny the fact that a small strike or individual act of terrorism from that group is likely. I don't see how a historical base rate of terrorist attacks really applies here considering how different the situation is right now than it has been traditionally. \n \n Of course, this question closes in February. ISIS has its hands full for the time being and may not have the capacity to coordinate anything outside of Iraq/Syria for a while.

I believe that they have the adequate technical capabilities required to launch an attack. \n \n 2. Jordan especially at risk. Took a long look at the geography on this one and ISIS seems to have a strong potential base of sympathizers along the Jordanian/Iraqi/Syrian borders: (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html).

ISIS positions itself as a sovereign state and is therefore highly motivated to conduct reprisal operations against military contributors to the collation against it.\n \n 4. Relatively simple fulfillment conditions and period length. Nothing spectacular or complex is required to fufill the conditions of this question.

Also, for each day, I computed a factor to show the ratio of the ice on that day to the previous-30-day average. I assumed that 2014 would be somewhere in that range, with the mean in the middle. \n \n I (arbitrarily) assumed that there was a 90% probability that the actual would be within this range.

A simple interpolation, gives me a 19% probability that the ice on Sept 15th will be less than it was in 2013.\n \n I need to refine the two assumptions mentioned above.

        "During August, sea ice extent declines more slowly as the sun starts to set in the Arctic and the sea ice minimum approaches. Thus, the window is closing on potential ice loss through the remaining summer. A simple way to estimate how much ice loss may occur during the rest of the summer is to extrapolate daily ice loss, using rates of ice loss from previous years. The approach provides a reasonable bracket on possible scenarios through September. Using the 1980 rate of ice loss yields the highest potential minimum this year, because the end of summer rate of ice loss in 1980 was very slow. The lowest potential minimum is estimated using the 2012 rate of ice loss, as there was rapid ice loss in 2012. No scenario suggests a minimum near the record low year of 2012. Most likely this year's minimum will be between 5.0 and 5.5 million square kilometers (1.9 and 2.1 million square miles). This number will be close to the 2013 level, but looks on track to *not* be less than 4.8 million square kilometers.",
